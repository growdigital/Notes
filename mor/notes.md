> 2) I want to change one of the outside sheds (the one next to the house) into a decked area for my hot tub, but I want to make it ideally open to the sky in the summer, but close-unable in the winter - maybe some tent/gazebo-like doors around it, or even proper concertina doors which can be opened or closed depending on the weather. If they were closed, there would need to be ventilation for the steam, and also the room would need the elcewtricas to be safe for being around water. Is this a Daniel Evans job or an Old Sullivan job because it‚Äôs an outside building?

> 3) I had the great idea this morning of making the grooves of the sheds into a green moss/grass roof! Can you deal with that sort of thing or do we need another contractor?
