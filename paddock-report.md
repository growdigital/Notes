* Wildlife, ornamental, food forest garden
* Low maintenance
* Sustainable
* Provide a foundational road map
* Keep within the £10k budget
* Ornamental, if not regimented, then at least regular - symmetry, with dead hedges & hedging
* Connect with kitchen garden
* Optimise flora & fauna
* Optimise aesthetics & screening

> I like gardening but I do like to do other things

* Maintenance - £2k, 100 hours @ £20 p/h, 14 days, 1 day per month
    * Get a gardener!
    * Wheeled brushcutter £1k - for meadow & paths
* Clay-lined pond 
    * 3ft deep max, for maintenance
    * Native planting!

* Budget £10k
* Meadow pasture near road
* Main path along cable

### Key design considerations:

* Clay-lined pond
* Grass paths
* Perimeter path
* Hedging
    * Plant for final size & width
    * Double thickness
    * Native where possible
    * Spines for habitat
    * Symmetrical shapes
    * Easterly, 2m max, not suckering
* Ground cover
    * Keep grass on 80%
    * Cut 1/3 every year with brushcutter
    * 20% other cover near house
* Trees & shrubs
    * Edible trees, big edible shrubs. 
    * Colourful foliage
    * ‘Named’ trees
    * Hawthorns! Ideal.
* Meadow
    * Scrape top soil
    * Land form
    * If animals, use electric fence

### Questions

* to optimise wildlife (fauna and flora)
> diversity of habitat & species, native where possible for _biomass_ ie hedging
* to screen better from the neighbours
> double thickness hedge
* to put in a pond
> clay-lined
* to have a dead hedge (I'm collecting already)
> make ornamental

* to access the paddock more easily through the kitchen garden
> remove fence, incorporate kitchen garden into paddock
* to be able to walk around the paddock/section of the paddock with mown pathways. Not hardstanding.
> grass paths, main double mower width, secondary single mower width
* to evaluate options to shift the kitchen garden fence line to enable better use of paddock and connect to kichen garden and house garden
> _design_ the gardens to work together
* to evaluate whether at the front, by the road, there is a reason to keep a small section for pasture?
> definitely, for habitat
* to recommend a groupings/selection of trees to provide wildlife cover/food/ and colour for human beings

I currently know:
* subsoil covers the bottom third
> where is
* spoil still in there
> see OS map, two buildings sited there
* pond at lowest point (as per sketch). Probs the best option. How big? Groundworks man said if he digs 6 feet he'll find water. But do I want a 6 foot deep pond??
> no, 3 feet deep (once clay is in) as easier to maintain
* Nettles more than brambles only at far end (not road end)
* Minimal maintenance please
* high voltage underground cable location will push pond to far end anyway.
* Remove stumps
> necessary?
* What to do with fallen ash tree
> standing dead wood!?
* Two more ashes look a little sick......

Budget £10 000 to include reparations to groundworks, pond digging, trees and shrubs, fencing and consultancy fees.
