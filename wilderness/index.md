East facing and sloping ¬æ acre walled garden, used for residential stays with outdoor activities for schools.

## Aim

To grow edible perennial crops together with herbs and native wild flowers within the walled garden, forging a connection with nature by providing forage for visitors and material for nature activities. The bulk of the food for the kitchen is supplied by the no-dig allotment.

## Recommendations

1. No-dig allotment
2. Mown grass flat area by children's tents.
3. Forest garden area on slope
4. Espalier trees
5. Mixture of edible perennials, herbs & native wild flowers
6. Possibly design garden with ecologist
7. Timings
    1. Schedule garden development across years
    2. Plant trees & big shrubs first year
    3. Define grass paths with mower first year
    4. Subsequent years, create forest garden beds

## No-dig allotment

I can really recommend Charles Dowding‚Äôs No-dig method. Compost is used as a surface mulch to suppress weeds, and also to add nutrients which are taken down into the soil. It reduces physical labour, increases yields and is better for soil health. As the method uses a fair amount of compost, I would recommend setting up a 3 bay compost heap.

Charles runs [1-day and 2-day courses](https://charlesdowding.co.uk/courses/) in Shepton Mallet, and has written some excellent books.

Also, I would collect the rainwater from the building next to the allotment, and store it in a series of water barrels. 

Longer term, you can look at introducing perennial vegetables into the allotment eg perennial kale, perennial leeks, Welsh Onions etc

For the polytunnel, you could possibly site it to the west of the allotment. I can recommend [Five Star Polytunnels](https://fivestarpolytunnels.co.uk/polytunnel-kits/).

## Forest garden features

1. **Paths**<br>Paths define access and areas. The sketch shows a _schematic_ set of paths, from the tents to the main destinations. For accessing the espalier trees and different parts of the forest garden, these would be augmented.
2. **Espaliers**<br>Espalier fruit trees are easier to harvest and prune. All walls can be used for different fruit and varieties.
3. **Hedging**<br>The site feels quite exposed. Relatively low hedging can be used to provide a sense of privacy, without compromising the view of the lower tents from the top tents.
4. **Grass**<br>Keep the grass on the flat area in front of the children‚Äôs tents! 
5. **Fruit bushes**<br>As the fruit trees are espaliers, there is space for a wide range of different species, from commonplace currants to the more unusual Salal, Chokeberries, Buffalo Currant, Blue Sausage Tree etc.
6. **Herbs & wild flowers**<br>I encourage the use of native plants where possible, as they have co-evolved with wildlife, are a food source for insect larvae and are essential for a healthy ecosystem. Practically every native plant is useful in some way (see the [PFAF website](https://pfaf.org/user/Default.aspx)) and many are herbs and wild flowers. They can also be very ornamental.
7. **Materials**<br>Plenty of forest garden plants can be used for land art, basketry, fencing etc
