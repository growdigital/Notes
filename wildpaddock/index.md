Consultation for creating a wildlife, ornamental and food forest garden design from a 1¬Ω acre paddock. Provide a foundational road map, including detailed planting plans, species list and budget breakdown. Naturalistic planting with subtle symmetry & well-situated seating.

Site is east-facing with clay soil, woodland scrub to the north, neighbours to the east, road to the south, house to the west.  

## 1. Key requirements

2. Low maintenance & sustainable
3. Optimise aesthetics & screening

## 2. Features

1. **Pond**, clay-lined wildlife 
2. **Hedges**, double thickness native hedge screen
3. **Paths**, perimeter & grass
4. **Native**, useful wild flowers & herbs
5. **Ground cover**, 80% grass
6. **Edible** trees & big shrubs
7. Sculpted **dead hedges**
8. Wild flower **meadow**
9. Diverse **habitat** for wildlife
10. Connection with **kitchen garden**
11. Maintain access to underground **electric cable**
12. Budget for **maintenance**!

> I like gardening but I do like to do other things

### 2.1 Pond

* Situated to northern, lowest end of site
* Test clay on-site for suitability
* 1 metre deep, for maintenance
* No more than 30¬∞ angle
* At least 20cm thick
* Find ‚Äúpuddler‚Äù!
* Further reference: [Clay lined pond](https://www.natureworks.org.uk/clay-lined-pond/) and [How to make a clay pond](https://www.flowerpotman.com/garden-pond-builder/how-to-make-a-clay-pond/)

### 2.2 Hedges

* On east side, 2m high maximum
* Double or even triple thickness
* Spiny hedging for habitat
* Native species where possible eg Cornus sanguinea, Alder Buckthorn etc See [plant list](https://bit.ly/paddock-plants)
* Plant for final size & width (reduce maintenance)
* Create symmetrical plantings

### 2.3 Paths

* Grass paths, mowed with [wheeled brushcutter](https://www.thegreenreaper.co.uk/oleo-mac-deb-518-wheeled-brush-mower)
* Double mower width for main paths, single width for access
* Perimeter grass path for access & maintenance

### 2.4 Native

* Generally better for diversity, as co-evolved with wildlife
* Diversity of species & habitat to support diversity wildlife
* See [Database of Insects & their Plant Foods](https://www.brc.ac.uk/dbif/hosts.aspx) for insect/plant interactions
* Almost every native plant has a practical use
* Can use native wild flowers aesthetically
* See [Plants For A Future](https://pfaf.org) for reference, or books by [Richard Mabey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Mabey)

### 2.5 Ground cover

* Non-grass ground cover expensive (¬£600ish per 100m¬≤)
* So, keep 80% ground cover as grass
* Divide into 3 areas, cut on 3 year rotation
* 20% non-grass, more ornamental nearer house
* Option to convert later

### 2.6 Edible

* All trees are specimen trees!
* Edible &/or ornamental
* Eg Cornelian Cherry, Scarlet Hawthorn, Chinese Dogwood, Sour Cherry, Quince, Tulip Tree, Sweet Chestnut etc
* Shrubs also edible/ornamental
* Eg Chokeberry, New Jersey Tea, Sea Buckthorn, Lemonade Bush, Saskatoon etc
* Hedges & ground cover provide bulk of native plants

### 2.7 Dead hedges

![Dead hedge](https://res.cloudinary.com/growdigital/image/upload/w_240/v1588061045/john-little-dead-hedge.jpg)

* As feature in their own right (architectural)
* Protection for establishing hedges
* Temporary screening from neighbours

### 2.8 Meadow

* Ensure species rich by being nutrient poor!
* Establish specific mix & maintenance for conditions
* Scrape upper layer of top soil
* Form features from top soil
* If animals, use electric fence
* Size?

### 2.9 Habitat

* Pond, different levels
* Dead hedges
* Different species in hedging
* Thorny species for nesting (eg Blackthorn, Barberry)
* Standing dead wood (architectural)
* Nutrient poor meadow
* Possibly use building rubble/subsoil as growing medium
* Possibly retain stumps

### 2.10 Kitchen garden

* Create flow from kitchen garden to wildlife garden
* Reconfigure fencing?

### 2.11 Electric cable

![Plan of electric cable](https://res.cloudinary.com/growdigital/image/upload/w_240/v1640642887/wildpaddock/electric.jpg)

* Ensure access to underground electric cable
* Possibly use for line of path?

### 2.12 Maintenance

* Ensure budget for maintenance
* Mostly weeding in first 2 years
* Mowing & pruning
* Sketch road map ahead
