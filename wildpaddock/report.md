[Home](https://notes.grwd.uk/paddock/) • [Schedule](https://notes.grwd.uk/paddock/schedule) • [Pinterest↗](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/NatureWorksGarden/wild-paddock/) • [Plants↗](https://bit.ly/paddock-plants)

Create a wildlife, ornamental and food forest garden design from a 1½ acre paddock with a £10,000 budget. Provide a foundational road map, including detailed planting plans, species list and budget breakdown. Naturalistic planting with subtle symmetry & well-situated seating.

Site is east-facing with clay soil, woodland scrub to the north, neighbours to the east, road to the south, house to the west.  

## 1. Key requirements

1. Support diversity of wildlife
2. Low maintenance & sustainable
3. Optimise aesthetics & screening

## 2. Features

1. **Pond**, clay-lined wildlife 
2. **Hedges**, double thickness native hedge screen
3. **Paths**, perimeter & grass
4. **Native**, useful wild flowers & herbs
5. **Ground cover**, 80% grass
6. **Edible** trees & big shrubs
7. Sculpted **dead hedges**
8. Wild flower **meadow**
9. Diverse **habitat** for wildlife
10. Connection with **kitchen garden**
11. Maintain access to underground **electric cable**
12. Budget for **maintenance**!

> I like gardening but I do like to do other things

### 2.1 Pond

* Situated to northern, lowest end of site
* Test clay on-site for suitability
* 1 metre deep, for maintenance
* No more than 30° angle
* At least 20cm thick
* Find “puddler”!
* Further reference: [Clay lined pond](https://www.natureworks.org.uk/clay-lined-pond/) and [How to make a clay pond](https://www.flowerpotman.com/garden-pond-builder/how-to-make-a-clay-pond/)

### 2.2 Hedges

* On east side, 2m high maximum
* Double or even triple thickness
* Spiny hedging for habitat
* Native species where possible eg Cornus sanguinea, Alder Buckthorn etc See [plant list](https://bit.ly/paddock-plants)
* Plant for final size & width (reduce maintenance)
* Create symmetrical plantings

### 2.3 Paths

* Grass paths, mowed with [wheeled brushcutter](https://www.thegreenreaper.co.uk/oleo-mac-deb-518-wheeled-brush-mower)
* Double mower width for main paths, single width for access
* Perimeter grass path for access & maintenance

### 2.4 Native

* Generally better for diversity, as co-evolved with wildlife
* Diversity of species & habitat to support diversity wildlife
* See [Database of Insects & their Plant Foods](https://www.brc.ac.uk/dbif/hosts.aspx) for insect/plant interactions
* Almost every native plant has a practical use
* Can use native wild flowers aesthetically
* See [Plants For A Future](https://pfaf.org) for reference, or books by [Richard Mabey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Mabey)

### 2.5 Ground cover

* Non-grass ground cover expensive (£600ish per 100m²)
* So, keep 80% ground cover as grass
* Divide into 3 areas, cut on 3 year rotation
* 20% non-grass, more ornamental nearer house
* Option to convert later

### 2.6 Edible

* All trees are specimen trees!
* Edible &/or ornamental
* Eg Cornelian Cherry, Scarlet Hawthorn, Chinese Dogwood, Sour Cherry, Quince, Tulip Tree, Sweet Chestnut etc
* Shrubs also edible/ornamental
* Eg Chokeberry, New Jersey Tea, Sea Buckthorn, Lemonade Bush, Saskatoon etc
* Hedges & ground cover provide bulk of native plants

### 2.7 Dead hedges

![Dead hedge](https://res.cloudinary.com/growdigital/image/upload/w_240/v1588061045/john-little-dead-hedge.jpg)

* As feature in their own right (architectural)
* Protection for establishing hedges
* Temporary screening from neighbours

### 2.8 Meadow

* Ensure species rich by being nutrient poor!
* Establish specific mix & maintenance for conditions
* Scrape upper layer of top soil
* Form features from top soil
* If animals, use electric fence
* Size?

### 2.9 Habitat

* Pond, different levels
* Dead hedges
* Different species in hedging
* Thorny species for nesting (eg Blackthorn, Barberry)
* Standing dead wood (architectural)
* Nutrient poor meadow
* Possibly use building rubble/subsoil as growing medium
* Possibly retain stumps

### 2.10 Kitchen garden

* Create flow from kitchen garden to wildlife garden
* Reconfigure fencing?

### 2.11 Electric cable

![Plan of electric cable](https://res.cloudinary.com/growdigital/image/upload/w_240/v1640642887/paddock/electric.jpg)

* Ensure access to underground electric cable
* Possibly use for line of path?

### 2.12 Maintenance

* Ensure budget for maintenance
* Mostly weeding in first 2 years
* Mowing & pruning
* Sketch road map ahead

## Questions & Answers

* to optimise wildlife (fauna and flora)
> diversity of habitat & species, native where possible for _biomass_ ie hedging
* to screen better from the neighbours
> double thickness hedge
* to put in a pond
> clay-lined
* to have a dead hedge (I'm collecting already)
> make ornamental/architectural
* to access the paddock more easily through the kitchen garden
> reconfigure fence, incorporate kitchen garden into paddock
* to be able to walk around the paddock/section of the paddock with mown pathways. Not hardstanding.
> grass paths, main double mower width, secondary single mower width
* to evaluate options to shift the kitchen garden fence line to enable better use of paddock and connect to kichen garden and house garden
> _design_ the gardens to work together
* to evaluate whether at the front, by the road, there is a reason to keep a small section for pasture?
> definitely, for habitat
* to recommend a groupings/selection of trees to provide wildlife cover/food/ and colour for human beings
> see [plant list](https://bit.ly/paddock-plants)
* spoil still in there
> see OS map, two? buildings sited there
* pond at lowest point (as per sketch). Probs the best option. How big? Groundworks man said if he digs 6 feet he'll find water. But do I want a 6 foot deep pond??
> no, 3 feet deep (once clay is in) as easier to maintain
* Nettles more than brambles only at far end (not road end)
> nettles easier to manage than brambles
* Minimal maintenance please
> baked in
* high voltage underground cable location will push pond to far end anyway.
> noted
* Remove stumps
> possibly leave for habitat?
* What to do with fallen ash tree
> standing dead wood?
* Two more ashes look a little sick......
> ditto
