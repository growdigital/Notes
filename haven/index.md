## Aim

A wildlife haven in a city location, a sense of green space, a source of edible plants, surrounded by beautiful roses. A flexible seating area.

Using a mixture of ornamentals, edibles and natives, ultimately create a thickly layered planting of perennials that require minimal maintenance and no watering (apart from the annual veg).

### 1. Gabion & water bowl

[![Sketch of water bowl on top of gabion](https://res.cloudinary.com/growdigital/image/upload/w_320/v1686652464/haven/sketch-gabion-pillar-waterbowl-230613.jpg)](https://res.cloudinary.com/growdigital/image/upload/v1686652464/haven/sketch-gabion-pillar-waterbowl-230613.jpg)  
_Sketch of gabion & water bowl (click for hi-res)_

The central feature. I would fill with recycled building rubble, sorted into different materials (brick, stone, concrete etc) and washed. Then fill the gabion with different ‚Äôstrata‚Äô. Top with bee logs (Larch logs drilled with range of hole sizes on one side), holes facing due south. Top with slim paving, to provide stable surface for water bowl, and overhang to stop water dripping into bee holes.

### 2. Love Seat

[![Love Seat in front of white house](https://res.cloudinary.com/growdigital/image/upload/w_320/v1677775133/max/love-seat.jpg)](https://res.cloudinary.com/growdigital/image/upload/v1677775133/max/love-seat.jpg)  
_Love seat in situ (click for hi-res)_

The hardstanding area to the north and east of the garden is expanded, to allow the Love Seat to be moved into different positions. You could even have wheeled Love Seat, with wheels that come into operation when one end is lifted. 

[![CAD plan showing love seat in different positions](https://res.cloudinary.com/growdigital/image/upload/w_320/v1686601518/haven/seat-positions-cad-230612.png)](https://res.cloudinary.com/growdigital/image/upload/v1686601518/haven/seat-positions-cad-230612.png)

Such a seat is really space saving, as it has an integral table.

### 3. Hoggin path

_John Little‚Äôs hoggin path using RBF (click for hi-res)_

A hoggin path is low maintenance, requiring minimal weeding. It also provides habitat for some solitary bee species. And you don‚Äôt need to line it with plastic landscape fabric.

RIO Aggregates in Essex provide a [Recycled Blended Fill](https://rioaggregates.co.uk/rio-product-range.htm), which means you don‚Äôt have to use mined material.

### 4. Screening with grass and willow

Use a tall native grass such as [Molinia 'Karl Foester'](https://www.knollgardens.co.uk/product/molinia-karl-foerster/) to provide light screening midway across the garden (see plan).

For the back, there will be a 4-5m high fruit tree in the northern corner, and Bowles Willow along the rest of the boundary. This is a very upright willow with a non-invasive root structure.

[![Closeup of willow leaves](https://res.cloudinary.com/growdigital/image/upload/w_220/v1686134876/haven/bowles-willow-clifftop-closeup.jpg)](https://res.cloudinary.com/growdigital/image/upload/v1686134876/haven/bowles-willow-clifftop-closeup.jpg)

_Bowles Willow in situ as screen (click for hi-res)_

Very easy to grow from cuttings from [Willow Nursery](https://willowsnursery.co.uk/product/bundle-of-20-x-50-cm-long-salix-viminalis-bowles-hybrid-chunky-willow-sticks-w221/) if you can‚Äôt find plants to buy.

### 5. Mini-shed

[![Upright shed with door open](https://res.cloudinary.com/growdigital/image/upload/w_220/v1686648802/haven/minished.jpg)](https://res.cloudinary.com/growdigital/image/upload/v1686648802/haven/minished.jpg)

Store your compost and tools in mini-shed with door, by the back door.

### 6. Big tree

![Small Asian Pear on tree](https://res.cloudinary.com/growdigital/image/upload/w_320/v1658849552/asian-pear-220712.jpg)

For the north corner of the garden, I would recommend an ornamental fruit tree, like an Asian Pear, an edible hawthorn, a crabapple, maybe even a small Chinese Dogwood. See the plant spreadsheet for details.

### 7. Front garden

[![Green roof cycle shelters](https://res.cloudinary.com/growdigital/image/upload/w_320/v1686652929/haven/john-little-cycle-shelters-science-museum.jpg)](https://res.cloudinary.com/growdigital/image/upload/v1686652929/haven/john-little-cycle-shelters-science-museum.jpg)

For the bin shelter, put in a **green roof**! John Little (one of my gardening heroes) has a green roof guide PDF that you can buy. And then fill the green roof with native plants!

[![Simple CAD on top of satellite view of small front garden](https://res.cloudinary.com/growdigital/image/upload/w_320/v1686654404/haven/front-garden.jpg)](https://res.cloudinary.com/growdigital/image/upload/v1686654404/haven/front-garden.jpg)

And I would put in a bed by the wall (size depending on access to bin shelter), and then fill it with native plants that can cope with full sun and no watering. 

### 8. Native plants

![Fox and Cubs orange flower](https://res.cloudinary.com/growdigital/image/upload/w_320/v1628024840/fox-and-cubs-210624.jpg)

Where possible, grow native plants, as they have co-evolved with wildlife. To get an idea of which plants support which species, see [Database of Insects and their Food Plants](http://dbif.brc.ac.uk/hosts.aspx). A native oak for example will support hundreds if not thousands of different species of invertebrates, lichen, fungi, algae, birds etc
