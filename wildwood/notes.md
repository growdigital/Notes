### Soil

* Best to make plan of land use, even if outline. Then, any remedial work for compacted soil doesn't have to be done for tracks, paths and hard standing areas.
* Basics of soil compaction on [gov.uk](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/remove-soil-compaction), 
* More information on [Forest Research](https://www.forestresearch.gov.uk/tools-and-resources/fthr/urban-regeneration-and-greenspace-partnership/greenspace-in-practice/practical-considerations-and-challenges-to-greenspace/soil-compaction-practical-considerations/)
* [Mole plough](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsoiler) or subsoil plough to break up compaction, generally used on agricultural land. Alternatively, attachment for digger.
