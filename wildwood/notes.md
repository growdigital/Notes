## Suggestions

### Caravan area

1. Create areas with bamboo & string
2. Consider uses — eg yurt & visiting caravan
3. Make sure track wide & smooth enough for vehicle access
4. Consider facilities — water, energy, wood, sunlight
5. Possibly [Holly](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Ilex+aquifolium) for boundary hedging? 

### Barn area

1. “all new buildings really should turn around and face the sun”! _\~Peter King_
2. Move barn position so it faces south.
3. Veg area becomes garden area
4. Test soil of wildflower meadow area, might be good enough for trees

### Woodland walk area

* To south of caravan area
* Create dead hedges against stock fence
* Remove lower branches to gain view
* Plant 1.5m hedge on west side for privacy
* Put a seat in!

### Structures

* Recommend roundwood
* Possible to build roundwood [passivhaus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_house)!
* Jamie at [Ty Pren](https://typren.co.uk/gallery-roundwood-timber-frame-projects/) — will do large projects in south England

### Soil

* Area was lumberyard, serious compaction
* Decide paths, areas, functions first, _before_ decompacting
* Agricultural decompaction uses [subsoiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsoiler) plough, can get digger attachments for other projects
* May need other amendments (nutrients, organic matter) before planting trees?
* Have site tested properly for compaction and soil profile 

### Deer proofing

[![Sketch of deer proof tree guard](https://res.cloudinary.com/growdigital/image/upload/w_320/v1655822511/wildwood/deer-proof-fence.jpg)](https://res.cloudinary.com/growdigital/image/upload/v1655822511/wildwood/deer-proof-fence.jpg)  
_Deer proof tree guard_

* 2 metre post & 1-1.5m post
* Weld mesh 50cm x 50cm
* 14 or 16 gauge (16 adequate)
* Mesh comes in 25m or 30m rolls
* Materials cost is approx £20 per tree guard (excluding labour)

Cheaper and easier to put tree guard around each tree than deer fence around whole garden!

### Planting

* Strip of land running west-east from entrance is good candidate for taller specimen trees like Sweet Chestnut.
* Area where wild flower meadow is now, is prime spot for fruiting crops, as full sun. Also, would be in direct line from new barn position.
* [Holly](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Ilex+aquifolium) is a good deer deterrent (not 100%), for shadier spots, particularly if some of wood thinned. So possible for part of perimeter of the caravan clearing.

### Soil

* Best to make plan of land use, even if outline. Then, any remedial work for compacted soil doesn't have to be done for tracks, paths and hard standing areas.
* Basics of soil compaction on [gov.uk](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/remove-soil-compaction), 
* More information on [Forest Research](https://www.forestresearch.gov.uk/tools-and-resources/fthr/urban-regeneration-and-greenspace-partnership/greenspace-in-practice/practical-considerations-and-challenges-to-greenspace/soil-compaction-practical-considerations/)
* [Mole plough](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsoiler) or subsoil plough to break up compaction, generally used on agricultural land. Alternatively, attachment for digger.
* [Structural Soils](https://www.soils.co.uk/) in Bristol, example of company offering services.
