## Update plan - Tue 9 May 2023

[![Section of garden CAD plan for Pond Bed](https://res.cloudinary.com/growdigital/image/upload/w_420/v1683626477/bedw/bedw-pondbed-230509.jpg)](https://codeberg.org/natureworks/bedw/src/branch/master/bedw-pondbed.pdf)

* Design wise, idea is to have trees & shrubs toward the back of the bed, with larger, colourful herbaceous flowering perennials (Purple Loosestrife, Meadowsweet). Toward the front of the bed, closest to the patio, would be a collection of wild flowers & cultivars for pollinators, with colour across the year (Oregano, Yarrow, Thyme, Sweet Woodruff, Fox & Cubs)
* Have added possible plants to [spreadsheet](https://bit.ly/bedw-plants)
* Might be nice to have focal point in front centre of bed eg a water dish. Again, depends on available space.
* The size of the gabions depends on space available. 
* A **lot** depends on what happens with removal of Blackthorn roots and concrete. The space left will determine the height and width of the planned gabion wall, the space for new plants and the soil makeup. Eg can use crushed concrete as growing medium for thyme.
* Have added pond bed CAD sketch (see image above) 
* Current thinking is one small tree (amelanchier, cornus) and three small shrubs at the back, a pollinator & wild flower garden at the front of the bed.
* I‚Äôve used ornamental Chinese Dogwood and the small Aronia cultivar 'Brilliant' as placeholders.
