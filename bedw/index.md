North-west facing garden, sloping down to small river valley. Site of an old mill, lots of water about the place. Stone house, at the end of a sloping drive, faces south-west.

## Aim

The first stage is creating an ornamental bed on the west bank of the pond (the Pond Bed). The design needs to relate to the other garden areas.

## Intimacy

The overarching requirement is to create _intimacy_ in the different garden rooms. Currently, the patio, pond and parts of the lawn feel too open to visitors down the track. This can be achieved with:

1. A screen of sorts in front of the Patio Bed
2. A low hedge on the left of the Patio Bed
3. A rose arch into the lawn
4. A post and rail fence by the side of the Pond Bed
5. A full Red Dogwood hedge on the northern boundary of the pond

The key feature of the Pond Bed is the relatively low post and rail fence. The roundwood materials and finish complement the stone of the house, whilst the height opens up the bed, its construction allows light through, all while providing a natural boundary to the path

This stage doesn’t include the patio area **but** it’s important to give the Pond Bed context. Here you can see the low hedge, protecting the patio from the path whilst letting light through. There is a taller hedge just visible to the right of the path entrance, and some sort of screen over the patio bed.

## Access

The other requirement is access, connecting the garden areas together. 

1. Create beds to the left and right of the public footpath. This will reduce mowing and maintenance long term.
2. Reinforce and emphasise the path running along the length of the Red Dogwood Hedge.
3. Create a path along the top of the bank, to enable access into the Pond Bed and connecting the lawn with the Dogwood path.
4. Add steps to the entrance into the lawn.
5. Add a New Bridge across the gulley to connect and extend the garden.

## Pond Bed planting & landscaping

There is a beautiful birch by the pond already, and the drama will be increased with the backdrop of a continous Red Dogwood hedge.

I would add a small ornamental tree, possibly a north American hawthorn or juneberry, or maybe a dogwood. These all have pale blossom, good autumn colour and edible berries, and they will all thrive in damp conditions.

For the shrub layer, I’d plant 3 small cultivars of Aronia. Again, beautiful blossom, edible berries and lovely yellow to red leaves in autumn.

There might also be room for the Witchhazel as well, depending on the cultivar size. I’d plant this closer to the patio, for the spring scent.

From a practical perspective, I think there is a large slab of concrete to the left of the bed, just below the surface. This might require a mini-digger, to extract and break up. A solution to moving the concrete (and large rocks) off-site is to put them in a low gabion wall, which would add support to the pond bank. My concern is that once the Blackthorn roots and concrete are removed, the bank itself will be unstable. Adding a gabion wall uses up the aggregate, provides support _and_ is an opportunity for wildlife habitat and diversity of plant species.

_The gabions would be lower, embedded into the bank & possibly planted_

The Pond Bed is also one of the sunnier spots in the garden, and with a generous mulch, there should be a good range of native wild flowers and edible ornamentals for planting into the boulder clay.
