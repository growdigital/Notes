North-west facing garden, sloping down to small river valley. Site of an old mill, lots of water about the place. Stone house, at the end of a sloping drive, faces south-west.

## Aim

The first stage is creating an ornamental bed on the west bank of the pond (the Pond Bed). The design needs to relate to the other garden areas.

## Intimacy & access

The overarching requirement is to create _intimacy_ in the different garden rooms. Currently, the patio, pond and parts of the lawn feel too open to visitors down the track. This can be achieved with:

1. A screen of sorts in front of the Patio Bed
2. A low hedge on the left of the Patio Bed
3. A rose arch into the lawn
4. A post and rail fence by the side of the Pond Bed
5. A full Red Dogwood hedge on the northern boundary of the pond

The key feature of the Pond Bed is the relatively low post and rail fence. The roundwood materials and finish complement the stone of the house, whilst the height opens up the bed, its construction allows light through, all while providing a natural boundary to the path
