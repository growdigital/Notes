Concept entry for the [Countryside Borders Competition](https://www.lcgd.org.uk/belvoir-competition/) at [The Belvoir Castle Flower & Garden Show 2022](https://belvoircastleflowerandgardenshow.co.uk/), sponsored by the [London College of Garden Design](https://www.lcgd.org.uk/).

## Aim

Species extinction is driven by habitat loss, climate change and monocultural farming practises on an industrial scale. Every garden is an ecological opportunity and I believe we should seize that opportunity to create a diversity of habitats with a diversity of native species.

‚ÄúOasis Bordering a Green Desert‚Äô attempts to include as many habitats & wild flowers as possible into a 2.4m¬≤ space.
