* Back with Matt when the sky is clear, which currently looks like Mon 12 Feb
* Matt will mark up path with red markers
* Jake will mark up with white cotton tape for structures and existing flat areas.

### Ideas

* Iron Ivy Tree - wrought iron tree, with Ivy growing up it. 
* [Green roofs](https://www.grassroofcompany.co.uk/our-juice), for the habitat win. They have [a book](https://grwd.cc/book-diy-guide-green-roofs).

### Fencing

![Cleft post and rail fencing](https://res.cloudinary.com/growdigital/image/upload/w_440/v1706996235/tir/peak-cleft-chestnut-with-sawn-chestnut-posts.jpg)

* Quote from Kingsley 35m cleft oak post & rail fencing £1,247 inc VAT, del & installation 
* Cheaper than [Cleftwood](https://www.cleftwood.com/) or [Peak Traditional Fencing](https://www.peaktraditionalfencing.co.uk/products/chestnut-oak-cleft-fencing/)

### Witches Hut and paths

* Great conversation with Jamie Miller from [Ty Pren](https://typren.co.uk/) about the Witches Garden Shed. 
  * A ballpark figure for a well constructed & resilient 6m x 4m garden shed is £15-20k. 
  * As the proposed use is for sorting and drying herbs, propagation, tool storage and animal feed, it should be permitted as an agricultural outbuilding. However, please do take professional advice on permitted development, as it does vary from council to council. The key thing is it’s not being used for accommodation.
  * [Planning permission: permitted development rights for householders](https://www.gov.wales/planning-permission-permitted-development-rights-householders) guidance from gov.wales
  * [Extending / changing your home](https://www.carmarthenshire.gov.wales/home/council-services/planning/extending-changing-your-home/) - guidance on Carmarthenshire County Council website
* Spoke with Matt Broome from [West Wales Trails](https://www.westwalestrails.co.uk), he can hopefully be onsite with me on Friday afternoon. He can mark up the proposed paths with flags, which means I can get a much better idea of spacing for planting, using an aerial photo. The key thing is to get the gradients right (I _think_ no more than 1:15). Matt has worked on a job for people with limited mobility, so has the specs to hand. A **ballpark** figure for landscaping the paths is £4-5k. Best to wait for Matt’s quote after his visit.
* Also spoke with the woodworker Kingsley Hudson, who makes oak roundwood post and rail fencing. I had envisaged fencing around the Witches Garden, to help with demarcation, so that the wood is wilder on the other side. He is getting an estimate for me at the end of the week.

## [Tue 19 Dec 2023](#tue-19-dec-2023)

* Design the garden as **a series of walks**; different lengths & gradients
* [Moon Gardening podcast](https://rootsandall.co.uk/podcast/moon-gardens/), ideas for the Night Garden Courtyard
* Concentrate on the **entrance** to the forest garden, make it enticing
