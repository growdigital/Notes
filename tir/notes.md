### Witches hut advice

Advice from a Reiki Master who also has shamanic training:

> once the directions are marked in the hut, I feel they need to research and then meditate there to see what feels right for them if they just wish to use wiccan teachings.  There will be elements, colours and animals that correspond with the directions. 

> However pyrite (fool's gold) should be popped in any windows/openings to create a positive and general protective glow around the hut and a smoky quarts point should be placed by the door pointing out.  A meditation with the smoky quartz point should be done focusing on firstly and always  -  for the greater good of all - then protectively whatever is sent to them is returned three fold.  

> Of course once the hut is finished a good smudging should be done (burning sage, and allowing/wafting the smoke to envelope the space with the intent to clear, cleanse and protect the space) White sage is best, and it can be brought on Amazon

I have sketched the rough direction of the main p0ath. It is as 11deg (need to double-check), so that it's a gradual slope to walk up. It is approximately 165m. There is also the perimeter path, which is used for maintenance and keeping the Bramble under control. This is about 260m. Landscapers to clear a path, so that can run wheeled brush cutter around it but it will be steep in places. Other job for path landscapers is clearing parking area at top. Also, need to discuss aggregate for paths and parking area.

1. Main path 165m 
2. Perimeter path 260m
3. Parking area 18m diameter

Also note the position of the polytunnel and potting shed, both facing due south. Potting shed is 5m x 3m, area for veg growing is _about_ 185m². Is this enough Russell? 

Really need to mark out the structures, existing flat areas, parking space and main path. Will do this on next visit.

* 20 solar panels 104cm x 175cm
* @ [35deg angle](https://www.cnet.com/home/energy-and-utilities/how-to-position-solar-panels-so-they-generate-the-most-energy/), 2-up is 114cm x 175cm, 10 wide is 1750cm. Height is 1.64m.
* In an array, landscape 10 wide
* Need to consider [planning](https://www.planninggeek.co.uk/gpdo/renewable-energy/class-b/) - 5m from boundary

_25mm cotton tape for marking out areas for aerial photos_

* Back with Matt when the sky is clear, which currently looks like Mon 12 Feb
* Matt will mark up path with red markers
* Jake will mark up with white cotton tape for structures and existing flat areas.

### Ideas

* Iron Ivy Tree - wrought iron tree, with Ivy growing up it. 
* [Green roofs](https://www.grassroofcompany.co.uk/our-juice), for the habitat win. They have [a book](https://grwd.cc/book-diy-guide-green-roofs).

### Fencing

![Cleft post and rail fencing](https://res.cloudinary.com/growdigital/image/upload/w_440/v1706996235/tir/peak-cleft-chestnut-with-sawn-chestnut-posts.jpg)

* Quote from Kingsley 35m cleft oak post & rail fencing £1,247 inc VAT, del & installation 
* Cheaper than [Cleftwood](https://www.cleftwood.com/) or [Peak Traditional Fencing](https://www.peaktraditionalfencing.co.uk/products/chestnut-oak-cleft-fencing/)

### Witches Hut and paths

* Great conversation with Jamie Miller from [Ty Pren](https://typren.co.uk/) about the Witches Garden Shed. 
  * A ballpark figure for a well constructed & resilient 6m x 4m garden shed is £15-20k. 
  * As the proposed use is for sorting and drying herbs, propagation, tool storage and animal feed, it should be permitted as an agricultural outbuilding. However, please do take professional advice on permitted development, as it does vary from council to council. The key thing is it’s not being used for accommodation.
  * [Planning permission: permitted development rights for householders](https://www.gov.wales/planning-permission-permitted-development-rights-householders) guidance from gov.wales
  * [Extending / changing your home](https://www.carmarthenshire.gov.wales/home/council-services/planning/extending-changing-your-home/) - guidance on Carmarthenshire County Council website
* Spoke with Matt Broome from [West Wales Trails](https://www.westwalestrails.co.uk), he can hopefully be onsite with me on Friday afternoon. He can mark up the proposed paths with flags, which means I can get a much better idea of spacing for planting, using an aerial photo. The key thing is to get the gradients right (I _think_ no more than 1:15). Matt has worked on a job for people with limited mobility, so has the specs to hand. A **ballpark** figure for landscaping the paths is £4-5k. Best to wait for Matt’s quote after his visit.
* Also spoke with the woodworker Kingsley Hudson, who makes oak roundwood post and rail fencing. I had envisaged fencing around the Witches Garden, to help with demarcation, so that the wood is wilder on the other side. He is getting an estimate for me at the end of the week.

## [Tue 19 Dec 2023](#tue-19-dec-2023)

* Design the garden as **a series of walks**; different lengths & gradients
* [Moon Gardening podcast](https://rootsandall.co.uk/podcast/moon-gardens/), ideas for the Night Garden Courtyard
* Concentrate on the **entrance** to the forest garden, make it enticing
