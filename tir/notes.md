## [Wed 31 Jan 2024](#wed-31-jan-2024)

* Great conversation with Jamie Miller from [Ty Pren](https://typren.co.uk/) about the Witches Garden Shed. 
  * A ballpark figure for a well constructed & resilient 6m x 4m garden shed is ¬£15-20k. 
  * As the proposed use is for sorting and drying herbs, propagation, tool storage and animal feed, it should be permitted as an agricultural outbuilding. However, please do take professional advice on permitted development, as it does vary from council to council. The key thing is it‚Äôs not being used for accommodation.
  * [Planning permission: permitted development rights for householders](https://www.gov.wales/planning-permission-permitted-development-rights-householders) guidance from gov.wales
  * [Extending / changing your home](https://www.carmarthenshire.gov.wales/home/council-services/planning/extending-changing-your-home/) - guidance on Carmarthenshire County Council website
* Spoke with Matt Broome from [West Wales Trails](https://www.westwalestrails.co.uk), he can hopefully be onsite with me on Friday afternoon. He can mark up the proposed paths with flags, which means I can get a much better idea of spacing for planting, using an aerial photo. The key thing is to get the gradients right (I _think_ no more than 1:15). Matt has worked on a job for people with limited mobility, so has the specs to hand. A **ballpark** figure for landscaping the paths is ¬£4-5k. Best to wait for Matt‚Äôs quote after his visit.
* Also spoke with the woodworker Kingsley Hudson, who makes oak roundwood post and rail fencing. I had envisaged fencing around the Witches Garden, to help with demarcation, so that the wood is wilder on the other side. He is getting an estimate for me at the end of the week.

* Design the garden as **a series of walks**; different lengths & gradients
* [Moon Gardening podcast](https://rootsandall.co.uk/podcast/moon-gardens/), ideas for the Night Garden Courtyard
* Concentrate on the **entrance** to the forest garden, make it enticing
