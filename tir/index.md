East facing sloping two acre field, partially terraced, adjacent to old coal mining site.

## Aim

A secluded forest garden with a focus on native plants, with a majority of edible and medicinal plants, incorporating a children‚Äôs play area, with a barbecue spot and a glamping tent for guests.

Near the house is a courtyard and barbecue area, filled with Mediterranean herbs for cooking and scented plants for the night. The dining patio is in a secluded spot by the house, with tiered beds. 

A hard standing walkway joins the courtyard and patio to the play area and lawn, and then the entrance to the forest garden, past the wildlife pond. Further along the path is the hydrotherapy pool and the vegetable and propagation area.
