## Summary

Optimal use of level areas around the house, with an extended dining patio planted with range of edible ornamentals, scented courtyard with a herb garden, pergola and summerhouse at the back of the garage, a play area and lawn around the corner, extending over the hard standing area to the forest garden entrance, wildlife duck pond and swimming pool. Just beyond lies the polytunnel and vegetable garden.

The existing terraces in the forest garden can be developed further up to the Witches Hut at the top of the garden for improved access, with trees planted between the terraces. Add smaller switchback footpaths for more direct access.

**Please note**, the garden design around house requires careful planning in relation to the parking area, swimming pool, patio extension and house extension (and circulation within house). 

## Initial key decisions

1. Size of parking & turning area (how many cars?)
2. External house doors & circulation inside
3. Size & position of swimming pool
4. Specification for Witches Hut
5. Budget

## Features

1. **Parking** - parking & turning area, with ramp to hard standing area.
2. **Hard standing walkway** - running from Scented Courtyard to swimming pool. For access & bikes. Possibly self-binding gravel (low maintenance, no plastic)?
3. **Dining patio** - extended from existing patio, planted with herbs for easy access for kitchen, and edible ornamentals (edimentals). Steps with handrail?
4. **Scented courtyard** - planted for privacy. Sunniest spot by the house. Possibly summerhouse/covered area at back for winter use. Pergola for shade in the summer. Use deciduous climber, then more sun in winter, more shade in summer. Herb garden taking advantage of sun for BBQ.
5. **Play area** - just round corner, grassed, with toys & storage, visible from house.
6. **Wildlife duck pond** - large enough for 2 ducks **&** wildlife! Clay-lined. Native water plants. Protected by some sort of hedge (dead hedge?) 
7. **Swimming pool** - covered, heated, for hydrotherapy
8. **Polytunnel** - annual veg area and polytunnel. Possibly propagation & small nursery, for bulk growing ground cover plants & shrubs for forest garden. Also, possibility of supplying & supporting local school garden?
9. **Forest garden entrance** - ornamental yet edible beds, highlighting entrance into the forest garden. Well maintained.
10. **Orchard** - big trees on northern boundary, soft fruit & cherries closest to house, hard fruit further away
11. **Terraces** - plant trees between terraces, for ease of access. Also, extend terraces up to top of garden. And supplement terraces with switchback paths for quicker access.
12. **Witches Hut** - glamping pod, overflow sleeping, place to dry herbs. Witches Garden defined by post & rail fencing. Grow herbs & witchy plants. Level area by gate for parking and deliveries. 
13. **Woodland Garden** - add to existing Hazel trees, create a magical woodland garden
14. **Willow Bed** - useful to have fast growing willow for biomass, for dead hedges & chipping
