## Project idea

750 words

allotments the perfect way in to sustainable gardening and agriculture. Everybody knows what an allotment is. agroforestry, agroecology. so many people locally working in agriculture, crossover (figures)

* About your community and who will benefit – especially how you will work with people who do not  usually engage in climate action. 
* What you propose to do. 
* Where your project will be delivered. 
* What outcomes - or positive changes - you will achieve with the project.  
    * You can tell us up to four outcomes for your project. 
    * They should be linked to our three programme priorities for this funding.  
    * For help with writing your outcomes read our [guidance on tracking progress](https://www.tnlcommunityfund.org.uk/funding/programmes/sustainable-steps-wales-action-grants/how-to-track-your-progress-ssw)
* What activities will take place to achieve your project outcomes including how you will share with others what you’ve done. 

### Programme priorities

1. Enabling communities in Wales who are not usually engaged in climate change to help tackle the climate emergency and inspire others.
2. Empowering community-led activities to reduce carbon emissions and promoting a sustainable, low-carbon future for Wales.
3. Evidencing impact and sharing what the group learns about how to reduce carbon emissions and engage communities in climate action. 

* Community - Newcastle Emlyn
* Who will benefit - residents without gardens as providing them allotments, residents with gardens (free plants, ideas), visitors to show gardens, visitors online, communities engaging in similar projects
* Two main elements, community allotments and community show gardens showcasing sustainable edible gardening methods. Free workshops (initially) for residents, free plants for residents, well-being for schools & residents, sustainable methods tie in with national curriculum for schools, plant-based 'pay-what-you-can' cafe and workshop space, run sustainably, composting toilets. Show gardens from small balcony & pots to agroforestry demonstration. Key thing is sustainable gardening methods themselves - perennial vegetables, fruit bushes, fruit & nut trees, nutrients, integrated pest control, native plants to build ecosystem, diversity, native plants support wildlife, inseparable
* Project delivered in Newcastle Emlyn, easy pedestrian access for residents
* Four outcomes:
1. Establish allotments where there are none, low carbon local food
2. Promote sustainable gardening methods locally and beyond, make hope visible, share on website
3. Community hub and community run project, run on participatry, inclusive principles (asset based community development & decision making)
4. Provide educational & well being resources for both schools

## How do you know this is the best approach

* How your community came up with the project idea – including who you’ve spoken to (organisations and people). 
* Any research you’ve done. 
* Any other existing, or planned activities in your community. 
* Any other sources of help (like advice or funding) that you can access. 
* How you have used learning and evidence from your past work, to make your new idea better (if applicable). 
* The potential negative impacts on the environment, if there are any, and how you will limit the impact.

* How you have used learning and evidence from your past work, to make your new idea better (if applicable). 

- Make it _community_ based. Previous wildlife corridors project, just me. Setting up CIC first stage, then connecting with other groups. 
- Agroforestry project, neighbour. Simplicity aligned with funding goals.
- Garden Wild project, connecting with suppliers, businesses, people, importance consistent social media to get word out
- Private wildlife & food forest garden design practise. **Long term management**

* Potential negative impacts on environment

- building. Use sustainable materials & methods, recycled. Roundwood, coppiced, larch. Insulated buildings. 
- services. Make it sustainable. Rainwwater harvesting. Composting toilets. Local food. Closed loop. Provide secure bicycle parking and car park. Link up with transport networks. Make the location central, within walking distance.
- habitat. **Create** diversity of habitat in your infrastructure. Any groundworks destroys habitat, be sure to put back more. Swift boxes, bee hotels, _embedded_ in infrastructure
