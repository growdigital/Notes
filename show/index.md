# Food Forest Show Garden üè°

[Home](https://notes.grwd.uk/show/)

## Introduction

I am making a preliminary application to the [National Lottery 'Sustainable Steps Wales'](https://www.tnlcommunityfund.org.uk/funding/programmes/sustainable-steps-wales-action-grants) programme.

The idea is a wildlife & food forest show garden, located in Newcastle Emlyn. It would be an educational resource, a community garden and a tourist attraction.

It would showcase sustainable gardening practices that are beneficial to wildlife, from small scale to large scale. 

Each of the half dozen standalone gardens are structured around a central workshop, caf√© and playground area, so that there are different techniques, materials and planting combinations on display.

The educational element would be links with Ysgol Gyfun Emlyn and Ysgol y Ddwylan, tying in with the national curriculum (art materials & inspiration, insect & plant associations, different observable habitats etc).

The community element would be individual allotments, and people can share in the plants from the show gardens.

## Elements

1. Community
2. Education
3. Showcase
