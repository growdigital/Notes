## 1. Project idea _750 words_

We rely on food served by fragile global supply chains. Our world will see a 1.5Â°C temperature rise within 5 years. Growing resilient food locally is one step towards a sustainable future.

The project is a community allotment and orchard coupled with a food forest show garden for the town of Newcastle Emlyn. The area has no allotments.

The show gardens will demonstrate sustainable gardening methods, plants and combinations for different sized plots, supported by workshops, with the whole process documented online for the benefit of individuals and similar projects.

A food forest (or forest garden) is a productive, sustainable, resilient and low maintenance garden that works with nature by emulating the edge of woodland to grow edible, mostly perennial crops. The farming equivalent is regenerative agroforestry. 

The show gardens and workshops are key to the project, as they will provide a sustainable income from visitors, whilst plant cuttings and expertise will be freely available to allotmenteers. This will help spread the principles and practise of forest gardening.

Most people know that an allotment is a plot of land for individual, non-commercial growing of food, and that a community orchard is a collectively managed collection of fruit and nut trees. It is only a short step to introduce perennial vegetables, which are more nutritious and require far less watering, edible shrubs, and system plants for fertility and integrated pest control.

Allotments and community orchard are the perfect entrance to transition to **sustainable gardening and agriculture**, and the show gardens and workshops provide the necessary  education, sharing and income.

Our community is Newcastle Emlyn. Allotmenteers will benefit, plus wider businesses (cafes, accommodation) from increase in visitors. ecotourism. Famililes. Schools will benefit, education and also food. food bank? Not emlyn. Engaging people who do not usually engage - pupils! people who just want to grow veg for their family.

> how you will work with people who do not usually engage in climate action

the community is more than the allotmenteers, it is the whole town, and outreach work is crucial to build and maintain links.

* by offering free workshops & plants/cuttings to local residents
* by having a series of show gardens, from small to big, showing what can be achieved in different sized spaces. free entry to local residents 
* people who want to grow veg on an allotment
* most allotmenteers don't view growing veg as climate action!

Show gardens from small balcony & pots to agroforestry demonstration. Key thing is sustainable gardening methods themselves - perennial vegetables, fruit bushes, fruit & nut trees, nutrients, integrated pest control, native plants to build ecosystem, diversity, native plants support wildlife, inseparable
* Project delivered in Newcastle Emlyn, easy pedestrian access for residents
* Four outcomes:
1. Establish allotments where there are none, low carbon local food
2. Promote sustainable gardening methods locally and beyond, make hope visible, share on website
3. Community hub and community run project, run on participatry, inclusive principles (asset based community development & decision making)
4. Provide educational & well being resources for both schools
