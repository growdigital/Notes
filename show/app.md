## Allotments & Food Forest Show Gardens

[Home](https://notes.grwd.uk/show/)

## 1. Project idea _750 words_

We rely on food served by fragile global supply chains. Our world will see a 1.5°C temperature rise within 5 years. Growing resilient food locally is one step towards a sustainable future.

The project is a community allotment and orchard coupled with a food forest show garden for the town of Newcastle Emlyn. The area has no allotments.

The food forest show gardens will demonstrate sustainable gardening methods, plants and combinations for different sized plots, supported by workshops, with the whole process documented online for the benefit of individuals and similar projects.

A food forest (or forest garden) is a productive, sustainable, resilient and low maintenance garden that works with nature by emulating the edge of woodland to grow edible, mostly perennial crops. The farming equivalent is regenerative agroforestry. 

The show gardens, workshops and nursery provide a sustainable income from visitors, whilst the community outreach with the allotmenteers, schools, farmers, socially excluded groups and young people extends the reach of the sustainable horticulture message.

Most people know that an allotment is a plot of land for individual, non-commercial growing of food, and that a community orchard is a collectively managed collection of fruit and nut trees. It is only a short step to introduce perennial vegetables, which are more nutritious and require far less watering, edible shrubs, and system plants for protection, fertility and integrated pest control.

Allotments and community orchard are the perfect entrance to transition to _sustainable gardening and agriculture_, and the show gardens and workshops provide the necessary education, knowledge sharing and income.

We are aiming to engage five related elements of our community who aren’t usually engaged with tackling the climate emergency:

1. Allotmenteers
2. School children
3. Socially excluded groups
4. Farmers
5. Young people

## Community elements

1. *Allotmenteers* — allotments predominantly feature annual vegetables, with a few fruit bushes. Annual vegetables require more maintenance and water than perennial vegetables. By providing show gardens, free workshops for residents and free plants from the nursery, the allotmenteers will gain the resources and expertise to transition to sustainable gardening.
2. *School children* — it’s essential all our children have a knowledge of sustainable food systems. By adopting one of the show gardens and owning its design, establishment and harvesting, a “forest garden club” (in conjunction with the Eco Council) could provide this, as well as a safe and calm well-being space. The beauty of forest gardening is that it’s far less maintenance than an annual veg patch.
3. *Socially excluded groups* — this covers a diverse range of individuals, including many low income families, some disabled people and some with mental health issues. Oftentimes, there is not the money, skills, education or cultural inclination to get involved with the climate emergency. By working with local charities and schools, ensuring the gardens and workshops are accessible by foot and by those with limited mobility, and making them free to residents, we can reach these varied groups.
4. *Farmers* — Newcastle Emlyn is predominantly an agricultural area, home to a livestock market and branches of the National Farmers Union Mutual and Clynderwen and Cardiganshire Farmers cooperative. There are agroforestry grants available, via the Welsh government’s Woodland Creation Scheme and the Woodland Trust’s MOREwoods. By having a working example of agroforestry near the centre of town, with free entry to residents, farmers will have an opportunity to explore sustainable alternatives for agricultural diversification that are far less dependent on fertilisers, fossil fuels and pesticides.
5. *Young people* — the show gardens, nursery and workshops would be fertile ground for training a new generation of horticulturists in sustainable gardening. By providing apprenticeships and employment, young people can acquire the skills and qualifications to stay in the area and pursue a sustainable career.

## 2. How do you know this is the best approach? _750 words_

Food forest gardens and agroforestry require less energy and water than traditional horticulture. These are key features of sustainable forest gardening practices: 

* Drought resistant & nutrient rich perennial edibles
* System plants for fertility
* Native plants where possible for integrated pest control
* Use space effectively with different layers
* Protection with windbreaks
* Planned water storage and usage
* Low maintenance due to perennials & ground cover

The ideas and best practices for more sustainable gardening exist but they are not widely recognised in mainstream horticulture. 

By coupling these best practices with existing local institutions (schools, councils, resilience groups) and recognisable structures (allotments, show gardens, workshops), we can share the knowledge directly rather than rely on traditional channels. We can make our own connections and share our learning.

The idea for our project was in the response to the lack of allotments in Newcastle Emlyn combined with a desire to enable community action on climate change.

The key takeaway from our research so far has been the importance of making critical connections: finding local collaborators, knowledge and groups whose interests overlap. The next stage is developing how these diverse community assets can be incorporated into the project’s goals and structure. 
s
These are people and organisations we have been in touch with:

* *Hazel Evans*, Carmarthenshire County Councillor and Newcastle Emlyn Town Councillor — Cllr Evans backs the project in principle and is invaluable with her wealth of local knowledge
* *Dave Thomas*, Newcastle Emlyn Town Councillor - newly elected, Cllr Thomas has some innovative and aligned plans
* *Mrs Kate Roberts*, Eco Council Coordinator, Ysgol Y Ddwylan — working in collaboration to create the school’s wildlife food forest garden
* *Ysgol Gyfun Emlyn* — contact with heads of Design & Technology, Science, Geography and Wellbeing, to discuss curricular activities and the “forest garden club”
* *Jim Bowen*, Ffynone Community Resilience, north east Pembs — group established 2019, now has four productive sites, including Field of Beans in Blaenffos, Clynfyw Care Farm in Abercych and Fruits & Nuts Community Garden in Cilgerran
* *Audley Burnett*, Newcastle Emlyn Resilience Group — recently established to build practical resilience in the face of the threats posed by the climate crisis
* *Steve Higgins*, Wellbeing Coordinator, HUTS Workshop, Adpar — a local mental health & learning difficulties support charity keen to collaborate on shared green spaces
* *Claire Turner*, Director of Naturewise Community Forest Garden, Cardigan — 5 acre community garden and source of great inspiration
* *Vicky Moller*, Grwp Resilience — umbrella organisation for a variety of resilience groups and businesses in West Wales
* *Sarah Wright*, Treasurer, Cardigan Allotments — invaluable information about running an allotment, issues, budgets, constitution, shared spaces etc
* *Natalie Stevens*, BlueGreenCymru, Newcastle Emlyn — well-being in nature charity, with a site in St Dogmaels and potential site near Newcastle Emlyn
* *Roger Spencer*, Owner, Trefedhyn Garden Centre, Newcastle Emlyn — helpful local garden centre with years of experience and local contacts
* *Witchhazel Wildwood*, Project Manager, The Orchard Project, Swansea — years of experience with community based growing projects
* *Jamie Miller*, Tŷ Pren, Lampeter — local business building sustainable roundwood structures which are ideally suited for the gardens
* *Anette Kelly*, Operations Manager CYCA — great advice on using Asset Based Community Development process for gathering community input
* *Sarah Wilson*, Head of Horticulture, Veterans Growth, Sussex — advice on funding, applications and running a community venture
* *Janet Manning*, Garden Water Scientist, Somerset — keen to support project by advising on sustainable water supply
* *Michelle Davies*, Horticulture Training Adviser, Coleg Sir Gar — contact for setting up horticultural apprenticeships

Natalie Stevens from BlueGreenCymru is hoping to set up a relatively small allotment on council land at Danrhelyg, a mile south west of Newcastle Emlyn. It would be an ideal partner project, although pedestrian access from Newcastle is limited with no footpaths. 

## Learning from past work

Jake Rayson’s key lesson has been the role of listening in the design process. A garden is all about the *interaction* between the site, the plants and the inhabitants, at all stages of its development.

An example of not listening was a landscaping job for a new build eco-homes development in Pembrokeshire. All the budget was spent upfront on the physical infrastructure rather than being shared with facilitating the new community in the site’s evolution.

Of particular relevance is an ongoing project with a local dairy farmer who wants to put 2.5 hectares over to agroforestry. This highlights a pathway to connect with the farming community.

Martin Haye’s continued charity work in the orchard has emphasised the importance of placing the participants at the *centre* of the decision making process.

## Environmental impacts

The potential negative impacts on the environment will be the building work and disruption. To limit the impact, we would run a biodiversity survey, to highlight species and habitat that can be retained. Ecology should also play a key role in the gardens that are created, designing habitat and using native species where possible.

As a visitor attraction, we want to encourage accessible and sustainable transport, which means careful design of the car park, bike facilities and footpaths.

## 3. Your organisation _500 words_

Garden Wild Plants CIC was set up to tackle the climate and ecological emergency by promoting the use of native plants in gardening. Its remit has expanded to include sustainable gardening practices for edible plants.

* *Jake Rayson* has been a forest gardener, educator and designer since 2015, when he moved with is young family to just outside Newcastle Emlyn. Climate action has been the driving force behind his horticultural career. He has hands-on horticultural experince, combined with extensive CAD and design skills and runs his own garden design business.
* *Martin Hayes* has been pruning, planting and advising on orchards for 40 years. He is co-chair of Gloucestershire Orchard Trust and has worked extensively with community groups, in West Wales and England. 
* *Daniel Richards* is an Independent Mental Health Advocate in Cardiff, originally from Brongest, Newcastle Emlyn. He has a keen interest in well-being, social justice and forest gardening. Climate justice is an integral part of climate action. He is moving back to the area and has established a forest garden at his parents’ old house.

The plan is to work closely with:

1. Newcastle Emlyn Town Council
2. Carmarthenshire County Council
3. Ysgol Gyfun Emlyn
4. Ysgol Y Ddwylan
5. Ffynone Community Resilience
6. Newcastle Emlyn Resilience Group

1. *Newcastle Emlyn Town Council* has well established local links and connections. Their role is crucial in acquiring the site and advocating on the projects behalf. 
2. *Carmarthenshire County Council* will play a pivotal role in planning, transport and building, and also in extending the reach of the project across the county.
3. *Ysgol Gyfun Emlyn* is central to the project’s educational ambitions, working closely to align the gardens with the school’s curricular activities and also setting up an extra-curricular “forest garden club”.
4. *Ysgol Y Ddwylan* likewise occupies a central position, and there are opportunities to integrate the project with the school’s existing wildlife food forest garden.
5. *Ffynone Community Resilience* serves as a shining exemplar of community land based climate action. We would very much like to learn from and be party to their processes and successes.
6. *Newcastle Emlyn Resilience Group* is the nascent, local resilience group, which is an ideal partner organisation, aligned with the principles and ethos of our project. We can learn and share a great deal.
