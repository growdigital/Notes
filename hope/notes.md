_Rough sketch to show layout_

* Use single page scroll website, for when fundraising starts. [Hugo scroll](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-scroll/) is the theme, [demo here](https://zjedi.github.io/hugo-scroll/)
* David Hunter, woodworker I‚Äôd like to use for benches [thecoppiceplot.com](https://thecoppiceplot.com/about/)
* Open source the plans and process

_Movable benches in assembly area, to show 2 different modes_


## Notes 230710

* Hope - built to be modular, built to be moved
* Grow it in situ, test it out first
* Guest speakers - JSO, Animal Rebellion
* Slate as building material, heritage
* Source of 'waste' material - brick, concrete, ceramic, sand, gravel?

## Denise chat 230705

* Possible Senedd backing? Contact Jane Davidson
* Constraint on space 10m x 15m
* Space for furnishings to move around, to accommodate diverse needs (Radical Inclusion pillar)
* Lightweight robust movable seating. Can have it as amphitheatre, then move them to individual breakout groups:<br>![Sketch of movable seats](https://res.cloudinary.com/growdigital/image/upload/w_320/v1688996168/hope/movable-seats-230705.jpg)
* Move according to the needs of everyone being able to have clear lines of vision and hearing
* 3 phases of the assembly
  1. Intro,
  2. Breakout discussions / decision prioritisation
  3. Plenary - gather ideas & suggestions, then prioritise for sharing
* Outputs could be quantifiable outputs, measured on graph (eg Climate Anxiety Scale)
* Outputs if they are decisions and recommendations are then shared at or after the process.
* [Trust The People](https://trustthepeople.earth/) running free online Community Assembly course in September
* XR [Choosing Our Future With Community Assemblies](https://rebeltoolkit.extinctionrebellion.uk/books/choosing-our-future-with-community-assemblies)
* Infrastructure
  * John Little approach of varied growing medium, build in complexity of habitat.
  * Infrastructure needs consideration of assembly and dis-assembly and moving to another location after RHS.
* Liaising with speakers eg
  * Dave Goulson - Bumble Bee Conservation Trust
  * Cleeve West ‚Äì homeless garden creator
* Need support with facilitators and to promote training to get practice in regularly in advance
* The XR Gardeners will be pulling together a list of experts for local groups to draw on

### Jake input

* Wildlife and forest garden
  * Creating habitat for wildlife, by building in structural complexity (ie nooks and crannies!) into the garden infrastructure (paths, hedging, growing material, seating, pillars etc). #
  * Diversity of native plants and wild flowers, to support larval stages of inverterbrates, as insects are the backbone of the ecosystem. 
  * Growing perennial edible crops that are resilient to climate changes, which also highlights the need for agriculture to change (ie toward agroforestry, away from energy intensive farming)
* Possible topics:  gardening in a climate crisis, industrialised horticulture, peat compost, native plants, perennial crops, community gardens, mass extinctions, resilient gardens, community gardens...

## Hope as a working name

Had a chat with Beth, I think Hope is a better working name than Crisis.
