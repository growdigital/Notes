## Notes 230723

> ‚ÄúCan gardens literally save the world? No‚Ä¶<br>
Gardens can save the world by saving us. They can bring us back into contact with diversity‚Ä¶<br>
Gardens as activism as surely as any art form‚Ä¶<br>
Gardens that stir our senses and give us actionable faith and hope.‚Äù<br><br>
_~ Benjamin Vogt, A New Garden Ethic pp158_

## Notes 230722

![Yellow dandelion flower](https://res.cloudinary.com/growdigital/image/upload/w_320/v1552572926/dandelion-FBFAEA50.jpg)

* Plant a big fat Dandelion front and centre. Edible, native wild flower, great for pollinators.
* Bugle, Yarrow, Meadowsweet. I will start adding these to [spreadsheet](https://bit.ly/hope-plants)
* Cheap, repurposed agricultural water trough as central water feature? Idea is to [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-design_movement) plans and costings, and make garden affordable for other community projects.

![Galvanised water trough](https://res.cloudinary.com/growdigital/image/upload/w_320/v1690023466/galvanised-water-trough.jpg)

* I spoke briefly with Natalie from RHS last week, she said 'size not an issue' at Hampton Court, so more leeway on width than 10m

## Notes 230719

* Mailing list, alternative to Substack/MailChimp?
  * [listmonk](https://listmonk.app/), free, self-hosted
  * [PikaPods](https://www.pikapods.com/apps) hosting $2 per month
  * [Railway](https://railway.app/pricing) hosting $5 per month

## Notes 230718

![Sketch of pipe in the ground](https://res.cloudinary.com/growdigital/image/upload/w_320/v1689682685/hope/rigid-plastic-pipe-self-binding-gravel-sketch.jpg)

Had a good talk with Gary, with whom I'm creating the primary school garden. He suggested a technique for creating a shape in self-binding gravel. Bury rigid yet flexible drainage pipe into the gravel, tamp it down, then lift out the pipe and replace with appropriate aggregate. In the case of the school garden, this is a labyrinth. For the Hope Garden, this could be markers for the moving benches.

### XR Waverley & Borders newsletter

> It‚Äôs really important to have hope. 

> Today it might feel as if we are losing the race to save ourselves. From every angle we are beset by disasters which we know are caused by climate catastrophes because of human activity. 

> Hope is a natural resource and we all have it. Sometimes it‚Äôs hard to find. Sometimes it‚Äôs overwhelmed by the negative things we see or experience. But it‚Äôs there, waiting for us to use it. Hope, when everyone taps into it and uses it positively, is a more powerful resource than oil and gas put together. It‚Äôs a more powerful resource that cynicism and greed. Hope drives us to action and when those two combine, great things can happen! 
Hope is what keeps XR rebels going. We know that by taking action against the government, fossil fuel industries and their financiers we are doing the right thing.

* [The People v Climate Change](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p097sbzc)
* Four possible sites
  1. Naturewise Community Forest Garden, [Cardigan](https://duckduckgo.com/?t=lm&q=aberteifi&ia=web&iaxm=maps&strict_bbox=0&bbox=52.055869154726594%2C-4.346676145782453%2C52.02633084566017%2C-4.272303854217512) - still waiting to hear back from Claire Turner. Ideally sited, next to the police station within walking distance of Cardigan
  2. Yr Ardd community garden, [Llandysul](https://duckduckgo.com/?t=lm&q=llandysul&ia=web&iaxm=about) - don't know much about the project, think it's in the town, I know one of the directors vaguely, strong Welsh links
  3. Meads Project, [Milford Haven](https://duckduckgo.com/?t=lm&q=Meads+Ct&ia=web&iaxm=maps&strict_bbox=0&bbox=51.73131000132282%2C-5.069970135626676%2C51.70657610132282%2C-5.008139164373318&metatoken=1) - early co-design stages. Bit of a trek (1 hour) for me but really interesting project using community assemblies
  4. Abergwili, Carmarthen - via Audley. [Parc yr Esgob](https://parcyresgob.org.uk/)?
* [Ffion Gwyn](https://www.ffiongwyn.co.uk/collections/frontpage), artist using Welsh wildlife names. Appeared on Countryfile
* Public access RHS Hampton Court:
> ‚ÄúFor gardens over 80m2, walk-through access is possible and should be specified on the application form (one-way access
requires a minimum path width of 1.5m; two-way access requires a minimum path width of 2m)

> The questions and framing of the questions is crucial to getting a successful outcome. If eg 2.5 hours per assembly, the rule of thumb is equal division of time between INTRO phase / DELIBERATION phase and OUTPUT / COLLATION  phase.<br>_Denise XR Gardener_ 

So, 2¬Ω hour assembly would have 50 minutes for intro, deliberation and collation phases.

## Notes 230716

[Footpath widths](https://www.natureworks.org.uk/footpath-widths/)

* 0.6m ‚Äî 1 adult only
* 0.9m ‚Äî 2 adults just
* 0.8m ‚Äî 1 pram/wheelchair only
* 1.15m ‚Äî pram/wheelchair + child
* 1.2m ‚Äî 2 adults comfortably
* 1.7m ‚Äî 2 prams/wheelchairs comfortably

## Notes 230712

* Brilliant meeting between Lindy, Audley and Jake, about fundraising and organisation structure. Minutes to follow.

## Notes 230711

![Sketch of garden](hhttps://res.cloudinary.com/growdigital/image/upload/w_320/v1689591503/hope/cad-sketch-230717.png)  
_Rough sketch to show layout_

* Invite **local** schools to an assembly
* Actually, use events theme for website, keep aingle page at beginning, then when get bookongs, switch on achedule and speakers/sessions
* Use single page scroll website, for when fundraising starts. [Hugo scroll](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-scroll/) is the theme, [demo here](https://zjedi.github.io/hugo-scroll/)
* David Hunter, woodworker I‚Äôd like to use for benches [thecoppiceplot.com](https://thecoppiceplot.com/about/)
* Open source the plans and process
* Bilingual, backed by Welsh govt?
* Will email Jane Davidson, one of the architects of the [Future Generations Act](https://www.futuregenerations.wales/about-us/future-generations-act/) may well be interested in the project, as she apparently supports Community Assemblies.

![Plan of movable benches in amphitheatre](https://res.cloudinary.com/growdigital/image/upload/v1689077853/hope/benches-sketch-230712.jpg)  
_Movable benches in assembly area, to show 2 different modes_

## Notes 230710

* Hope - built to be modular, built to be moved
* Grow it in situ, test it out first
* Guest speakers - JSO, Animal Rebellion
* Slate as building material, heritage
* Source of 'waste' material - brick, concrete, ceramic, sand, gravel?

## Denise chat 230705

* Possible Senedd backing? Contact Jane Davidson
* Constraint on space 10m x 15m
* Space for furnishings to move around, to accommodate diverse needs (Radical Inclusion pillar)
* Lightweight robust movable seating. Can have it as amphitheatre, then move them to individual breakout groups:<br>![Sketch of movable seats](https://res.cloudinary.com/growdigital/image/upload/w_320/v1688996168/hope/movable-seats-230705.jpg)
* Move according to the needs of everyone being able to have clear lines of vision and hearing
* 3 phases of the assembly
  1. Intro,
  2. Breakout discussions / decision prioritisation
  3. Plenary - gather ideas & suggestions, then prioritise for sharing
* Outputs could be quantifiable outputs, measured on graph (eg Climate Anxiety Scale)
* Outputs if they are decisions and recommendations are then shared at or after the process.
* [Trust The People](https://trustthepeople.earth/) running free online Community Assembly course in September
* XR [Choosing Our Future With Community Assemblies](https://rebeltoolkit.extinctionrebellion.uk/books/choosing-our-future-with-community-assemblies)
* Infrastructure
  * John Little approach of varied growing medium, build in complexity of habitat.
  * Infrastructure needs consideration of assembly and dis-assembly and moving to another location after RHS.
* Liaising with speakers eg
  * Dave Goulson - Bumble Bee Conservation Trust
  * Cleeve West ‚Äì homeless garden creator
* Need support with facilitators and to promote training to get practice in regularly in advance
* The XR Gardeners will be pulling together a list of experts for local groups to draw on

### Jake input

* Wildlife and forest garden
  * Creating habitat for wildlife, by building in structural complexity (ie nooks and crannies!) into the garden infrastructure (paths, hedging, growing material, seating, pillars etc). #
  * Diversity of native plants and wild flowers, to support larval stages of inverterbrates, as insects are the backbone of the ecosystem. 
  * Growing perennial edible crops that are resilient to climate changes, which also highlights the need for agriculture to change (ie toward agroforestry, away from energy intensive farming)
* Possible topics:  gardening in a climate crisis, industrialised horticulture, peat compost, native plants, perennial crops, community gardens, mass extinctions, resilient gardens, community gardens...

## Hope as a working name

Had a chat with Beth, I think Hope is a better working name than Crisis.
