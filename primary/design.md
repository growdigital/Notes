# Primary design notes 🌈

_Colourful, fruitful, delightful & useful. A wildlife food forest garden for the children, insects and teachers!_

* Show map

**Viewpoint exercise** — everyone stand around far edges of garden. What can you see, what do you feel? Walk back slowly the quickest way you can!

* Get teaspoon of soil

[A map is not the territory!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map%E2%80%93territory_relation#%22A_map_is_not_the_territory%22)

## Design

* Put things in right place
* **Looking** and **thinking** (observation & consideration)

### Flourish

What things need, _not_ want to **flourish**

1. Self centred — what _you_ need
2. People centred — what your friends need
3. Life centred — what living things need
4. Places centred — the places we live (soil, rivers, trees, reefs)

A teaspoon of soil contains between 100 million and 1 billion [bacteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria), several thousand [protozoa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protozoa), up to hundreds of [nematodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nematode) and several metres of [fungi filaments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypha)

By comparison, 30 trillion human cells in the body vs [38 trillion bacteria](https://www.sciencefocus.com/the-human-body/what-proportion-of-the-human-body-is-bacteria-and-how-do-we-measure-it/)! 

### The right plant in the right place

* Soil — type, acidity, water?
* Sun — where is it? how much?
* Native where possible! 🍃 🐛
* Diversity of plants & habitats

## Ideas

Eco-council, add your best ideas!

Here are some I collected earlier:

* Autumn colour for art projects
* Native wild flowers for wildlife
* Recycled, low fertility rubble for low maintenance wild flowers
* Recycled substrates for paths
* Rainwater harvesting
* Quiet, sheltered seat
* Art material piles - clay, stones, sand, gravel etc

**Imagine the best places exercise** — put your favourite idea on a bamboo pole, put it where you think it should go
