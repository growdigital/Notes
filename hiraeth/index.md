Hilltop exposed, south-east gently sloping 5¬Ω acre improved pasture, and 2 acres of woodland with small stream on east boundary feeding into larger stream on south boundary.

## Aim

Potential for One Planet Development, with associated land-based activities. Create a sheltered, nature-rich and welcoming space, with productive fruit trees, coppice, domestic polytunnel, vegetable and herb gardens. A space for BBQ workshops and Forest School activities.

1. Choose sites
2. Soil tests
3. Manage existing land
4. Design & plant windbreaks & canopy
5. Build home
6. Build features
    1. Communal area
    2. Forest school paths
    3. Car parking
    4. Wildlife pond
    5. Reed beds
    6. Renewables
    7. Seating areas

1. **Choose sites**<br>Very important to choose which areas will be dedicated for which function: home, workshops, communal area. You need to design planting around these permanent features, including paths & tracks.
2. **Soil tests**<br>Take about 4 or so topsoil samples (from below grass roots), put in small jars, get tested for [NPK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labeling_of_fertilizer) levels plus [acidity](). **Mark on the map** where the samples have been taken from. Also, test for soil structure using [sausage test](https://www.farmersweekly.co.za/farming-basics/how-to-crop/how-to-do-a-soil-test/) or [soil jar test](https://hgic.clemson.edu/factsheet/soil-texture-analysis-the-jar-test/). 
3. **Manage existing land**<br>The key is to stop the bramble from the hedgerow growing into the field. The easiest way is to mow a perimeter path using a wheeled brush cutter. I use an [Oleo-Mac WB 51 S6](https://www.thegreenreaper.co.uk/oleo-mac-deb-518-wheeled-brush-mower). The grass can be mowed once every couple of years. Keep an eye out for self-sown bramble and tree saplings. If you introduce livestock once you have planted trees, you need to assemble tree guards, which gets very costly. Pigs can be used for clearing mown bramble roots, making sure the area is secure.
4. **Design & plant windbreaks & canopy**<br>Once you know where your permanent features are, you can design windbreaks and canopy layer around them. These are planted bare-root in the winter, as much cheaper and more likely to take. You need to keep the trees mulched & weeded, to stop grass encroaching, otherwise, minimal mowing of grass required.
5. **Build home**<br>So important to get this in the right place! [T≈∑ Pren](https://typren.co.uk/) build roundwood structures from local Larch. I can also recommend an architect if you need one.
6. **Build features**<br>Once you have started building, if you can, use earthwork machinery for other landscaping tasks. These are the features I would consider in order, with features bringing in income first:
    1. **Communal area** - some sort of shelter (marquee?) for BBQ and Forest School workshops
    2. **Forest school paths** - paths & platforms in the wood for initial Forest Schools.
    3. **Car parking** - 2-3 possible sites, nice to visually hide them. Area under power lines is boggy.
    4. **Wildlife pond** - needs to be childproof, yet also can be educational resource, designed carefully
    5. **Reed beds** - for house. I have been recommended Rick Hudson from [Cresswater](https://www.cresswater.co.uk). He says 'recommend your client seeks advice from local planning office & Natural Resources Wales'
    6. **Renewables** - need to consider siting and groundworks for renewables
    7. **Seating areas** - level areas for seating, with views, very important for everyone

## Potential income streams

* **Coppice** - [Coppicewood college](https://coppicewoodcollege.co.uk/) run courses in Eglyswrw, Pembs. Good contact for woodworkers, ties in with Botanic Garden Wales local craft fairs.
* **Charcoal making** - land-based activity, opportunity for resale
* **Photo opportunities** - sunflowers, pumpkins & other photogenic crops & backdrops! Bear in mind when creating seating areas, & mobile caf√©,
* **BBQ workshops** - weekends, max 10 people
* **Forest School** - weekdays, max 10 peope
* **High margin produce**
  * **Mushrooms** - see Anthony & Emma, [Hyphae Shroomery](https://www.facebook.com/hyphaemushrooms/), Pembs 
  * **Sauces** - chillies, elderberry, hawthorn etc
  * **Fermented foods** - sauerkraut, kimchi, Jerusalem Artichoke
  * **Apple juice** - easier & quicker than cider to make & sell. [Martin Hayes](https://www.theapplemancan.uk/) is an orchardist and can give advice on varieties, planting, pruning, juicing & bottling
  * **Mobile caf√©** - near communal area
