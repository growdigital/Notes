South-west-west facing timber framed listed cottage, sheep dipping brook on south and west boundary, hill behind, track in front. Over half acre mature ornamental garden, on different levels with cotswold stone walls and features. 

## Aim

Create a wildlife and food forest garden full of edible and native plants, combined with useful and magical areas and seating, all sympathetic to the existing building, new extension and surroundings.

## Recommendations

The recommendation at this stage is to **live with the site** for the summer, with a focus on establishing the vegetable area. Learn about your garden through debrambling, weeding, mowing & maintaining the existing hedge. Also consider best places for paths & gates.

1. **Now** - veg area, tend garden, access
2. **Autumn 2023** - extension
3. **Winter 2023** - fell trees, windbreaks
4. **Spring 2023** - gates, fencing 
5. **Summer 2024** - design
6. **Winter 2024** - plant

### 1. Now

1. **Veg area**<br>Focus your growing efforts in the first year on cultivating the vegetable area, experimenting with perennial veg and herbs (see Reference). Also try low growing ground cover (eg [Rubus rolfei](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=Rubus+rolfei)) in combination with perennial veg. Advise moving Goji berry further away, as not so productive. Also experiment with herbs, Mediterranean and other.
2. **Fruit tree pruning**<br>Martin Hayes, Cheltenham-based orchardist for pruning & advice on felling, staking and local community projects.
3. **Stake fruit trees**<br>New trees need proper staking (Martin can bring stakes & ties).
4. **Wild play area**<br>Beyond the veg area is ideal for wild play (possibly den?), away from water and line of sight from veg area and kitchen diner.
5. **Log steps**<br>from play area to track. Larch logs as last longer. See illustration for technique. Will encourage access.
6. **Paths**<br>consider _flow_ of paths, what are the primary routes? Also think about which paths would benefit from being hardstanding, the most high traffic paths. I have found Cotswold self-binding gravel supplier.
7. **Seating**<br>Get a recycled cheap ‚Äòn‚Äô cheerful lightweight seat, try it in different parts of the garden at different times of the year to see where the best seating areas are. Coffee in the morning, cocktails in the evening! Also, consider screening. For example, the seating by the sheep dip is exposed to the track, and would benefit from judicious planting.
7. **Forage**<br>By foraging, you are exploring the local area, finding what grows well and where, as well as learning about native plants and ecosystems. It really is important to acquaint yourselves with your terrain, geology, hydrology and climate.

### 2. Autumn 2023

1. **Build extension!**<br>This is the big one, which is why I think put any further planting (apart from vegetables) on hold until after it‚Äôs done.
2. **Rainwater harvesting**<br>for veg area. With all the new roof space, would make sense to divert it for watering any annuals and young plants in the veg area.

### 3. Winter 2023

1. **Remove Leylandii**<br>On the south boundary, there are a few remaining Leylandii. Keep the Silver Birch, Wild Cherry. 
2. **Dead hedge**<br>Using the brash from the felled trees, create an elegant dead hedge on the south boundary. See photo for inspiration. 
2. **Windbreak**<br>Plant a 2m-ish native & edible windbreak on the west & south boundary. On the south boundary, this will be on the **south** side of the dead hedge. When the hedge has grown enough to provide protection, the dead hedge will have decomposed. The path is on the **north** side of the dead hedge. On the west boundary, the hedge can be grown on the _other_ side of the stream, providing protection & screening without encroaching on the garden space. 
3. **Trim hedge**<br>trim the existing native hedge which runs by the field. Possibly look at laying the hedge? This will close up the gaps more readily. There should be workshops and practitioners in the area.
4. **Move greenhouse**<br>By the veg area is closer and more accessible to the new kitchen, and it also gets more light (necessary for your chillies & tomatoes!).

### 4. Spring 2024

1. **Woodland garden gate**<br>Richard said there was a gate here previously. By opening up gates, you increase circulation and make tending the gadren more accessible. It‚Äôs also a beautiful way in to the Woodland Garden. I can imagine this area in a hot summer being a real focal point.
2. **Secret woodland gate**<br> Creating a new gate in the corner of the property would make a whole Secret Woodland area, with the most amazing  bridge into the main Woodland Garden (see photo below). It would also provide access for maintenance.
3. **Fencing**<br>A locally sourced roundwood post and rail fence would IMHO have a big impact on the magical feel of the property, _and_ it would last longer than cut timber (if you‚Äôre using Sweet Chestnut or Larch). There is about 60m of fence, for which a ballpark figure is ¬£2,500. The woodworker I use recommends Say It With Wood, who are in Ledbury. Please check their prices.
