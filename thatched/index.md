## Aim

Create a wildlife and food forest garden full of edible and native plants, combined with useful and magical areas and seating, all sympathetic to the existing building, new extension and surroundings.

## Recommendations

Overall, the recommendation is to **live with the site** for the summer, with a focus on establishing the vegetable area. Learn about the garden by debrambling, weeding, mowing & maintaining the existing hedge.

1. **Now** - develop veg area, maintain gadren, add access
2. **Autumn 2023** - extension
3. **Winter 2023** - remove trees, create windbreaks
4. **Spring 2023** - gates, fencing 
5. **Summer 2024** - design
5. **Winter 2024** - plant garden
