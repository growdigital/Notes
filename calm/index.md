West facing field in Lincolnshire, blue clay sub-soil, damp conditions. In a micro-climate, south-westerly winds yet unusually calm.

## Aim

A calm, meditative wildlife and edible garden. A labyrinth of accesible paths, with secluded yet safe areas, defined by a series of ponds, screened with a variety of windbreaks, using native plants where possible.

Garden is primarily for family, with view to using it for quiet group day retreats. Grown children with grandchildren on the way, so need to consider safety as well as access.

There is also an interest in place-based textiles, which fits nicely with the ethos of local provenance native plants. So there is great scope for natural dye plants and possibly textile plants.

## Management

With grandchildren, qualifications and writing in full swing for the next few years, it‚Äôs important to stage the work to reduce the maintenance.

1. Design
2. Create pathways
3. Planting windbreaks & trees
4. Creating ponds & earth-forming
5. Plant ponds
6. Plant areas with shrubs & herbaceous perennials

Accessibility is also key, for all ages and mobility. Hoggin paths (self-binding gravel) are natural materials, low-maintenance and good wildlife habitat around the edges. They are quite pricey, so a balance needs to be struck with the cheaper grass paths. Possibly have a phased building of hogging paths?

To keep areas secure, thick double hedging can be planted or installing locally-sourced roundwood fences and gates.

For any large area of rough grass, I recommend a wheeled brush cutter for cutting the grass paths. In my experience, they cope much better than a standard lawn mower if the grass gets too long. We have an [Oleo-Mac WB 51 S6](https://www.thegreenreaper.co.uk/oleo-mac-deb-518-wheeled-brush-mower) with everything stripped down! At ¬£1,000 it is expensive but very useful. 

## Plants

There is a small selection of plants, mostly damp loving natives, on the spreadsheet [bit.ly/calm-plants](https://bit.ly/calm-plants), with links to [Plants For A Future](https://pfaf.org/user/Default.aspx) and the native [Plant Atlas](https://plantatlas.brc.ac.uk/). I can also recommend the [Database of Insects and their Food Plants](http://dbif.brc.ac.uk/hosts.aspx), to see the associations between native plants and insects.

There is also a Pinterest page for the garden [pinterest.co.uk/NatureWorksGarden/calm](https://pinterest.co.uk/NatureWorksGarden/calm)
