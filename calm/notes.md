* top lawn & house are at about 46m level. There's a drop from the patio of about 1.5m to the lower lawn and labyrinth That slopes gently away then more so at the entry to the field, probably another 0.5m, but the land slopes up to the boundary with our neighbours. The higher area is about .5m higher, at about the height of the boundary or a little more. The elongated dip is about 0.7m down, then as you approach the road it rises up again by about 0.7m
