## Description

### Areas

1. Wall Garden
2. Patio
3. Shade Garden
4. Forest Garden

There‚Äôs parking at the east end of the house and entrance is via the patio to the front door through an archway, or there is pedestrian access from the track, by the Wall Garden. This is a large expanse of wall beneath the patio, which is covered by climbers that flower in succession, and up some steep, curved steps, past another climber to the patio archway.

The patio is divided into 3 areas by curved, low raised beds. The L-shaped seating area on the east end, the enclosed water feature in the centre and the BBQ seating area at the west end, opposite the conservatory.

A path takes you around the side of the house past the Shade Garden, two partially shaded, stone wall edged beds, filled with low, woodland plants.

The path continues round the back of the house to the right, through to the forest garden. Along the left of the grass path is a perennial vegetable area; to the right is a rustic post and rail fence. As well as apple and pear trees, there are hazels and fruit bushes, protected by fruiting windbreaks on the north and easterly boundaries, and all covered with low-maintenance ground cover.
