## [Mon 23 Oct 2023](mon-23-oct-2023)

Last Friday I managed to get hold of 4kg Unwins Wildflower seed mix. This is to add bulk to the further reaches of the meadow, as I had concentrated the Celtic Wild Flowers seed to the area immediately on the left (ie most visible from the path and window).

The seed mix isn't fully described, so I emailed, and this is the species mix:

* Borage
* Red Campion
* White Campion
* Red Clover   
* Corn Poppy    
* Cornflower    
* Ox-eye Daisy
* Lesser Knapweed
* Musk Mallow  
* Ribwort Plantain
* Self Heal

## Ideas

* Small Jasmine for corner (Italian Jasmine 'Revolutum' or Primrose Jasmine), replace Everlasting Pea
* Plants for front beds!
* David add supports to arch
* Move Solomon's Seal to kitchen garden
* Plant Yarrow by Sedum in Wall Garden
* Replace posts on inside Wall Garden
