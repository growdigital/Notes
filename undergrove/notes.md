## Nest boxes

Email from Alison Heal

One of the species most in need of suitable nest boxes is swifts. They would need to have several boxes under the eaves of a relatively tall building eg two storey. They don't always start using them quickly - it can take years, but including a swift call imitation can help.
Swallows and house martins are also short of nest sites because of replacement of wooden soffits etc with uPVC. They also need to have several ledges / "nests".
Sparrow terraces are a good option too.
For longevity, woodcrete is better than wood, but of course has the "crete" element.
Depending on exact location and aspect, an owl box would be something worth considering.
I am copying in a couple of colleagues who might have more information and who may be able to suggest an expert closer to Adpar.
Without knowing anything about your clients environment or infrastructure, it is also worth considering landscaping, planting and garden / woodland maintenance.
For woodland / gardens:
A range of boxes with a range of hole sizes might be best, including an owl box or two.
