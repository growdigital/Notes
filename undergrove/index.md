_First draft of the CAD plan_

An east-facing rear garden of a new eco-house, with a grove of oaks at the back beyond a steep slope. Outdoor office, lawn and raised beds.

## Aim

To maximise the available space to create a secluded, accessible, multi-level woodland garden, using native and edible plants.

_Rear slope, click to expand_

The key areas are:

1. **Rear slope** ‚Äî with 2, possibly 3, seating areas: the den, west-facing bench and possibly a space above the den. The path needs to be level for accessiblity, with solid steps, so possibly some sort of cost-efective retaining walls. The plants need to screen the areas from the neighbours and with some seclusion from the rest of the garden.
2. **Lawn area** ‚Äî keep openness and functionality of the lawn, but improve accessibility, particularly to the raised beds. Possibly a central feature, keeping enough space for temporary structures.
3. **Climbers & espaliers** ‚Äî really important to green the garden whilst maximising the use of space.
