## Background information

> Do you wish to include any additional background information to help us assess your application? (optional)

We are interested in family scale agroforestry, in the form of fruit and nut trees & bushes. 

It is an opportunity to bring sloping land back into productive cultivation whilst simultaneously increasing wildlife habitat and biodiversity, using native species where possible. The designated land is too steep for contractors machinery to cultivate. 

The dairy farm was organic from 2007 to 2015 but, due to a change in UK government policy, organic was no longer economically viable. In 2016 we noticed a dramatic reduction in plant and insect diversity, most noticeably in clover distribution and bee populations.

We are looking to create a wildlife friendly, low maintenance and productive area, with good access and using sheep for light grazing around the trees to keep the grass down.

Our farm was organic

## Woodland Trust MOREwoods and MOREhedges initiatives

> Partial funding is available to landowners who intend to plant on at least 0.5 ha (1.25 acres) of non-wooded land in total at between 1000 and 1600 trees per hectare. If a scheme is approved and the applicant can plant and maintain the trees themselves, we will cover up to 75% of the cost of the trees, tree protection and support. 
 
> A wide variety of native trees is available for MOREwoods projects, and our advisers will recommend which species are suitable for the planting site and planting objectives. The trees we supply are sourced and grown in the UK to reduce the risk of pests and diseases. Alternatively, we arrange a contractor to plant and maintain the woodland we will cover 60% of the total cost. This contractor planted option is only available for sites planting at least 1 ha in England, Wales or Northern Ireland. 

> We can offer a wide range of UK native tree and shrub species and all of our stock is sourced and grown within the UK. Successful MOREwoods applications will receive either a phone call or site visit from one of our expert woodland creation advisers. They will discuss objectives for the woodland and recommend suitable tree species and tree protection for the site. You can find out more about our MOREwoods funding here: <https://www.woodlandtrust.org.uk/plant-trees/large-scale-planting/morewoods-faqs>
 
> We also offer support to landowners who would like to plant native hedging. With MOREhedges, we can subsidise up to 75% of the cost if the applicant will plant more than 100 metres of new hedging and allow a large tree to grow every six metres. You can find out more about MOREhedges here: <https://www.woodlandtrust.org.uk/plant-trees/large-scale-planting/morehedges-faqs>
 
> The application is no-obligation, it just allows us to gather the information we need to check if the project is eligible, and the site is suitable for planting. Alternatively, you could call Natural Resources Wales again to ask if you would qualify for the Glastir Woodland Creation scheme.  More details can be found on this link: <https://naturalresources.wales/guidance-and-advice/business-sectors/forestry/woodland-creation/glastir-woodland-scheme/?lang=en>
