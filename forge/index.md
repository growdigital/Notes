South facing 1.2 acre long house in Ceredigion, with holiday let, polytunnel and field, bounded by 2 waterways.

## Aim

Create low-maintenance gardens for aesthetics, privacy, wildlife and edible crops.

## Garden areas

1. [Veg](#1-veg-garden)
2. [Holiday](#2-holiday-garden)
3. [House](#3-house-garden)
4. [Pond](#4-pond)
5. [Studio](#5-studio-garden)
6. [Caravan](#6-caravan-garden)

The key here is to break the garden down into different areas, to make it manageable over time.

1. I have put the areas in order of suggested work, so start with the Veg Garden. 
2. Then put in the _infrastructure_ for the garden
  * Paths, using mown paths for now
  * Canopy layer (the trees)
  * Windbreaks - dead hedges, screening plants or hedges (native where possible)
3. Maintain this structure by mowing paths regularly, removing Bramble, Bracken & saplings
4. Only need to mow grass areas once a year, if that
5. Then revisit each area to remove turf, lay bark mulch and plant out ground cover **that you have propagated!!** (to keep price down)

Always keep bare earth covered, with ground cover plants long term, wood chip short term, bark for short-medium term.

### 1. Veg Garden

* Annual vegetables initially
* Experiment with perennial veg over time
* Rainwater harvesting from studio, 2x IBC tanks
  * Pump, for hose & dripline
  * 14mm black dripline eg [100m kit](https://www.waterirrigation.co.uk/catalog/product/view/id/41651/s/hydrosure-black-dripline-kit-14mm-x-100m-30cm-spacing/category/3754/) from Water Irrigation
  * Possibly [water timer](https://www.waterirrigation.co.uk/hydrosure-dual-outlet-water-timer-with-digital-display.html)
* Move logs to fernery under Beech (you can also use large logs to clear grass in an area as well, takes a few months but act as a good mulch)
* Create open cold composting area with tarpaulin cover
* Possibly move compost bins a bit further west
* Clumping boundary plants (eg [Geranium 'Dreamland'](https://www.penlanperennials.co.uk/plant/hardy-geraniums/geranium-dreamland/)) for grass path

### 2. Holiday Garden

* Red Oak - remove glass, establish **central leader**, cut back other branches to be lower than central leader, eventually raise canopy to let in more light beneath and get it back to being a tree again
* Remove Rosa rugosa and persicaria under apple trees, keep it mown, get it back to grass 
* Fernery & stumpery under Beech, with lots of wildlife habitat on stream side of path
* Remove plastic 
* Don't plant nuts, as won't work with squirrels
* Plant 2-3m high fruit trees & shrubs in forest garden area

### 3. House Garden

* Richard making 1-1.2m high metal fence from Corten steel
* Use screening plants for privacy, eg Molinia 'Karl Foerster'
* Possible side garden, for more privacy from holiday let, with screening plants
* Take out Buddleia & Elder, which block view west

### 4. Pond

* Pond being dredged, with shelves being put in, removing Flag Iris (Iris pseudacorus, which is [native](https://plantatlas2020.org/atlas/2cd4p9h.vwt)!)
* Path around pond, for guests as well
* Amazing stream potential for plants, eg Turkish Rhubarb, flowering native wild flowers, ferns etc

### 5. Studio Garden

* Architectural ornamental bed in front, Richard has ideas
* Get rid of Buddleia by Studio
* Past architectural bed, possibly use bed as experimental edible ornamental bed
* Possibly screening hedge/boundary between Holiday Garden and Studio Garden? Also, barrier for Veg Garden

### 6. Caravan Garden

* Caravan on concrete plinth
* Parking for cars by access point
* Possibly hedging to infill the gaps on road hedges
* Get rid of rhodendron, replace with low hedging plant for screening just back from edge of gorge, possibly some Cornus sanguinea cultivar?
* Plane tree getting very tall and close to powerlines
* Some sort of seating area on mound, with movable seating area, possibly pergola, sheltered area, movable seating?
