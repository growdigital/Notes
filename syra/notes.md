Planted Cornus sanguinea hedge, on the westerly boundary at the bottom, leading up to Alder Buckthorn.

Matt and Marley have finished bench cutting the paths and putting in the steps. It looks quite barren but really there is a mulch of top soil on what was already there and everything (including Bramble!) will grow again.

ImportantApprox 200m of path total
ImportantEssentially 3 main paths
Important2x seating areas 4m diameter - level, create subsoil surface, create bank
* Use mini-digger
* 1-2 Ash trees to fell - work with Bryn chainsaw & mini-digger to move logs
* Work on hourly rate ¬£35p/h (approx ¬£250 per day)
* Ball-park estimate approx 5 days = ¬£1,250 approx

I don't know what your budget is for the whole project. It is possible to do it in sections, although more complicated.

Key thing is to make a rough track to Ash trees first, fell the trees, move the logs, then finish the paths, otherwise you'll trash the paths with the felling.

It would be good to catch up soon to discuss, as Matt has time now to do it, and the trees are arriving November, which would be great timing.
