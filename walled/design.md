The idea is to use the structure of the existing main paths, and then have circular arcs cutting through the quarters. This keeps the geometry but loosens up the shapes, and also provides a nice line for the smaller internal windbreak hedges to follow.

* **Paths** ‚Äî I‚Äôd keep the form of the main paths (if we can find them easily!) because they tie in with the original plan, the doors and the glasshouse. Plus, plants with extensive root systems would struggle if planted on top. As for material, gravel or hoggin for 540m would be really expensive, so I would advise grass paths for the main runs, with hardstanding paths only around high traffic areas (eg glasshouse, central feature). Also, as it won't be a public garden or a working traditional walled garden, there won't be the footfall to justify the expense. Width, keep them narrower, from 1 to 3 mower widths.
* **Windbreaks** ‚Äî the 4m high walls will protect 8x the distance ie 32m. This is ‚Öì the width of the garden, so internal windbreaks are essential. Traditionally, there would be a shelterbelt to the north and east of the garden. I would add to these areas, and also seriously consider an 8m high shelterbelt to the south and the west, set back from the wall so as to avoid shading but providing additional protection (64m). 
* **Canopy** ‚Äî I think we want to keep the central feature area and the glasshouse clear of shade, so the really tall canopy trees can sit in the far north and east corners of the garden. You can also have very upright species, like Italian Alder, which don't cast much shade and which can also have their lower branches removed. Smaller trees (4-8m) about the placde aren't so much of an issue.
* **Veg beds** ‚Äî because of the vastness of the site for one family, I‚Äôd recommend keeping a relatively small portion under more intensive cultivation, whether annual or perennial veg. Generally, it would be sited nearer to the dwelling, so it depends on where that's sited, either the existing house or the new build to the east.
* **Central feature** ‚Äî on the sketch, I've added a wildlife pond where the ‚Äúdipping pond‚Äù would have been. This was a traditional feature for dipping watering cans. Alternatively, it could be a small tree, like a Strawberry Tree or a Stone Pine. Personally, I'm more drawn to the water as a central feature, as there‚Äôs more going on and it ties in with the history. If there‚Äôs the budget, I‚Äôd make a platform for wildlife pond dipping!
* **Climate Battery Glasshouse** ‚Äî question over cost. [Climate Battery Calculator](http://www.ecosystems-design.com/climate-battery-calculator.html)
* **Outbuildings** ‚Äî for potting, storage & processing.
* **Slip gardens** ‚Äî for more planting. Deer?
* **Maintenance** ‚Äî mown grass paths, trees & shrubs plant for final size, permanent ground cover.
