## Fruit tree notes

* Jake add more trees for double sided cherry walk?
* "equivalent replacement" - flexibility if variety not available
* Crabapple - arbours - Jake sketch up and review different cultivars
* Arbour with wires on top & sides. 6 posts, 6 trees - Jake do sketch for mix of varieties

## Hazelnut reference

    * Gustav Zeller 
    * Red filbert Corylus maxima
    * Gunsleberts 
    * Cosford
    * Lang Tidlig Zeller
    * White Filbert Corylus maxima

## Apple proportions Jun 2022

* Early - 25%
* Late - 30%
* Cooking - 15%
* Cider - 30%

> With as many old good producing varieties as possible

## Client trip notes Jun 2022

* for the cider apples I have written to a local company to ask them what they recommend 
* for the earlyâ€™s, lates and good storage apples I am happy to hear your recommendations.
* Add Asian pear on north wall
* Move Japanese garden to the North east corner tea house to be placed as far east as possible and slightly south of the electric cable (approximately 25% of the distance between the wire and the wall entrance on the east wall) 
* The pond around the tea house can not be positioned further west than the east entrance on the north wall, as I believe the old underground tunnel runs north / south just near to the that entrance.
* The tea house should be facing halfway between West and South/West.
* What do you mean with "Scrub"?
* Allow the north/south path to flow all the way through the garden, through the Gabion wall and move the Strawberry tree, maybe there should be 4 strawberry trees, one in each of the borders near to the center
* Add some more "Udo" Plants
* Try to add a little more symmetry either side of the paths, so that it looks symmetrical (as much as possible) as your eye drifts down the path from entrance to entrance
* Maybe extend the mixed berry bushes to 3 of the quarters, missing out the Veg quarter.
* I think the fernery was just a place holder, but this space will need to remain free from trees.
* Japanese Acers (Maples) - for a bit of color (not too large)
* Med area will move to the north west corner, I guess that we leave this space open now? unless  you have a good proposal, I am thinking maybe more on the medicinal and exotic flower side? Any thoughts?
* Add low functional arced wind breaks in to the vegetable section.

## Wire support for espalier trees

* Height of the walls 5 metres. For this size, larger rootstock â€” MM106 for apples, Quince A for pear, St Julien A for plum. 
* The first wire is just above knee height (about 55cm)
* Subsequent wires are spaced at 45cm
* The top wire is 100cm from the top of the wall. This leaves a metre for the central leader of the tree.
* This works out at about 8 wires (with 1.3 metre gap at top)

## Costings trees

* Price for trees would be between Â£20 and Â£30.
* There's approximately 100 trees, so that is Â£2-3,000.
* Hedging is  a different matter. You want to plant 3-5 plants per metre, to get a thick hedge (though can depend on species). Bare-root hedging is approximately Â£1-2 per plant. 
* There's approximately 180 metres of hedging in total, at Â£5 per metre is Â£900.

That's a real guesstimate btw!

## Wildlife hedging

Reply from Sandra Stewart at Celtic Wild Flowers:

* Alder Buckthorn 5m x 4m - In a sheltered spot this may be possible. Ours in the garden is established and is about 3m x 2m.
* Purging Buckthorn 6m x 3m - This seems very tall. Usually about 3m x 3m
* Wild Privet 3m x 3m - Normally about 1.5m x 3m.
* Cornus sanguinea 2.5m x 2.5m - This seems about right to us.

I think Wild Privet is more like 2.5m ðŸ¤”

## Email from Lee

> an area just near my parents house that isnâ€™t possible to plant in as the land has dropped away a bit. I would say it is a distance of 2 to 3 meters from the house and atleast the full width of the house.

> there are some small trees in the north west corner of the garden that donâ€™t seem to be doing very well, possibly because it looks like they are planted on the old path.

## Wildlife habitat

* Ponds. 3 of em.
* Gabion wall
* Masonry bee homes!!! https://www.bumblebeeconservation.org/redmasonbee/

* Something community wise
* Food, beauty & medicinal

## Martin fruit tree advice

* Use walls for training fruit
* Â½ apples, other Â½ divided between plum, pear, cherry
* Cherry blossoms first, put on sunnier spots
* Apples blossom May, can put later varieties on north facing wall
* Orchard becomes Other Fruit orchard! (Autumn Olive, Amelanchier, Aronia, Asian Pear, Persimmon etc)

## Lusi trip

* Video entering garden from different entrances
* Frame yard and boundary
* Photo back shed(s)
* Location of IBC and compost bays


## Survey notes â€” 13 Mar 2022

> North south path 47,4 from west wall and 45,1 to the east wall. 
> Path width 8ft, measured near to the center of the garden
> East west path 30,3m from the front entrance of the greenhouse, path is 8ft wide
> Group of larger stones 5 to 10cm below the surface 49,2m to the south wall, 43,4 to the east wall, 51,7 to west wall, 33,8 to the door of the greenhouse, could of been part of a larger construction/central feature but it was really difficult to separate the turf and the stones. Picture below.
> The Paths where made up of many small stones and it was not clear where the edges where really but I think they where about 8ft wide all around the edge of the garden and 9ft away from the wall. 
> 1. Even though it rained quite a lot there where no water puddles in the garden.
> 2. Even though my fathers has lost the measured sketch, he does remember that there was a circle in the middle, so not exactly like the old maps.
