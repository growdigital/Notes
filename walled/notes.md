## Response to Client trip notes Jun 2022

> for the cider apples I have written to a local company to ask them what they recommend

very useful website <https://www.scottishfruittrees.com/>

> for the earlyâ€™s, lates and good storage apples I am happy to hear your recommendations.

recommended, see second tab of <https://bit.ly/walled-plants>

have added half dozen extra cherry trees to Japanese Garden, to make it more of a walk _through_ the cherry trees

> Add Asian pear on north wall

doesn't need extra heat, so keep on northern part of east/west walls

> Move Japanese garden to the North east corner tea house to be placed as far east as possible and slightly south of the electric cable (approximately 25% of the distance between the wire and the wall entrance on the east wall) 

decision to keep Japanese Garden where it is (noted where?!)

> The pond around the tea house can not be positioned further west than the east entrance on the north wall, as I believe the old underground tunnel runs north / south just near to the that entrance.

ditto

> The tea house should be facing halfway between West and South/West.

ditto

> What do you mean with "Scrub"?

untidy meadow! tbh, I would treat both areas the same as meadow

> Allow the north/south path to flow all the way through the garden, through the Gabion wall and move the Strawberry tree, maybe there should be 4 strawberry trees, one in each of the borders near to the center

good idea. have added gabion walls to the southern quadrant beds, to provide more protection/seclusion

> Add some more "Udo" Plants

these are perennial layer, which are really only 'positional', as not yet planned that phase

> Try to add a little more symmetry either side of the paths, so that it looks symmetrical (as much as possible) as your eye drifts down the path from entrance to entrance

noted. have doubled up the Italian Alders on the east and west entrances (keep the lower branches pruned to reduce shading), plus a Medlar and a couple of cherries

> Maybe extend the mixed berry bushes to 3 of the quarters, missing out the Veg quarter.

done ðŸ™‚

> I think the fernery was just a place holder, but this space will need to remain free from trees.

noted

> Japanese Acers (Maples) - for a bit of color (not too large)

yes will research but pricey! Also look at Berberis thunbergii purpurea as a possible (purple leaves)

> Med area will move to the north west corner, I guess that we leave this space open now? unless  you have a good proposal, I am thinking maybe more on the medicinal and exotic flower side? Any thoughts?

See above (areas stay where they are)

> Add low functional arced wind breaks in to the vegetable section.

## Fruit tree notes

* Jake add more trees for double sided cherry walk?
* "equivalent replacement" - flexibility if variety not available
* Crabapple - arbours - Jake sketch up and review different cultivars
* Arbour with wires on top & sides. 6 posts, 6 trees - Jake do sketch for mix of varieties

## Hazelnut reference

* Gina Bates, hazel orchard in Scottish Highlands <https://twitter.com/hilltopgina/status/1535285484271943680>
* Gina's cultivars
    * Gustav Zeller 
    * Red filbert Corylus maxima
    * Gunsleberts 
    * Cosford
    * Lang Tidlig Zeller
    * White Filbert Corylus maxima

## Apple proportions Jun 2022

* Early - 25%
* Late - 30%
* Cooking - 15%
* Cider - 30%

> With as many old good producing varieties as possible

## Wire support for espalier trees

* Height of the walls 5 metres. For this size, larger rootstock â€” MM106 for apples, Quince A for pear, St Julien A for plum. 
* The first wire is just above knee height (about 55cm)
* Subsequent wires are spaced at 45cm
* The top wire is 100cm from the top of the wall. This leaves a metre for the central leader of the tree.
* This works out at about 8 wires (with 1.3 metre gap at top)

## Costings trees

* Price for trees would be between Â£20 and Â£30.
* There's approximately 100 trees, so that is Â£2-3,000.
* Hedging is  a different matter. You want to plant 3-5 plants per metre, to get a thick hedge (though can depend on species). Bare-root hedging is approximately Â£1-2 per plant. 
* There's approximately 180 metres of hedging in total, at Â£5 per metre is Â£900.

That's a real guesstimate btw!

## Wildlife hedging

Reply from Sandra Stewart at Celtic Wild Flowers:

* Alder Buckthorn 5m x 4m - In a sheltered spot this may be possible. Ours in the garden is established and is about 3m x 2m.
* Purging Buckthorn 6m x 3m - This seems very tall. Usually about 3m x 3m
* Wild Privet 3m x 3m - Normally about 1.5m x 3m.
* Cornus sanguinea 2.5m x 2.5m - This seems about right to us.

I think Wild Privet is more like 2.5m ðŸ¤”

## Email from Lee

> an area just near my parents house that isnâ€™t possible to plant in as the land has dropped away a bit. I would say it is a distance of 2 to 3 meters from the house and atleast the full width of the house.

> there are some small trees in the north west corner of the garden that donâ€™t seem to be doing very well, possibly because it looks like they are planted on the old path.

## Wildlife habitat

* Ponds. 3 of em.
* Gabion wall
* Masonry bee homes!!! https://www.bumblebeeconservation.org/redmasonbee/

* Something community wise
* Food, beauty & medicinal

## Martin fruit tree advice

* Use walls for training fruit
* Â½ apples, other Â½ divided between plum, pear, cherry
* Cherry blossoms first, put on sunnier spots
* Apples blossom May, can put later varieties on north facing wall
* Orchard becomes Other Fruit orchard! (Autumn Olive, Amelanchier, Aronia, Asian Pear, Persimmon etc)

## Lusi trip

* Video entering garden from different entrances
* Frame yard and boundary
* Photo back shed(s)
* Location of IBC and compost bays


## Survey notes â€” 13 Mar 2022

> North south path 47,4 from west wall and 45,1 to the east wall. 
> Path width 8ft, measured near to the center of the garden
> East west path 30,3m from the front entrance of the greenhouse, path is 8ft wide
> Group of larger stones 5 to 10cm below the surface 49,2m to the south wall, 43,4 to the east wall, 51,7 to west wall, 33,8 to the door of the greenhouse, could of been part of a larger construction/central feature but it was really difficult to separate the turf and the stones. Picture below.
> The Paths where made up of many small stones and it was not clear where the edges where really but I think they where about 8ft wide all around the edge of the garden and 9ft away from the wall. 
> 1. Even though it rained quite a lot there where no water puddles in the garden.
> 2. Even though my fathers has lost the measured sketch, he does remember that there was a circle in the middle, so not exactly like the old maps.
