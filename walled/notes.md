## Wildlife hedging

Reply from Sandra Stewart at Celtic Wild Flowers:

* Alder Buckthorn 5m x 4m - In a sheltered spot this may be possible. Ours in the garden is established and is about 3m x 2m.
* Purging Buckthorn 6m x 3m - This seems very tall. Usually about 3m x 3m
* Wild Privet 3m x 3m - Normally about 1.5m x 3m.
* Cornus sanguinea 2.5m x 2.5m - This seems about right to us.

I think Wild Privet is more like 2.5m ðŸ¤”

## Martin fruit tree advice

* Use walls for training fruit
* Â½ apples, other Â½ divided between plum, pear, cherry
* Cherry blossoms first, put on sunnier spots
* Apples blossom May, can put later varieties on north facing wall
* Orchard becomes Other Fruit orchard! (Autumn Olive, Amelanchier, Aronia, Asian Pear, Persimmon etc)

## Survey notes â€” 13 Mar 2022

> North south path 47,4 from west wall and 45,1 to the east wall. 
> Path width 8ft, measured near to the center of the garden
> East west path 30,3m from the front entrance of the greenhouse, path is 8ft wide
> Group of larger stones 5 to 10cm below the surface 49,2m to the south wall, 43,4 to the east wall, 51,7 to west wall, 33,8 to the door of the greenhouse, could of been part of a larger construction/central feature but it was really difficult to separate the turf and the stones. Picture below.
> The Paths where made up of many small stones and it was not clear where the edges where really but I think they where about 8ft wide all around the edge of the garden and 9ft away from the wall. 
> 1. Even though it rained quite a lot there where no water puddles in the garden.
> 2. Even though my fathers has lost the measured sketch, he does remember that there was a circle in the middle, so not exactly like the old maps.
