## Overview 

Ro. had covid so only waved at him at a distance. Ri. spoke at a distance wearing masks. It was useful to chat. Ri.  feeling older and would like to move into village, but Ro. is keen to stay. The garden is really for Ro. & client’s dream, she’s not seen the design so couldn’t give any feedback herself. They used to keep chickens and Ro. has grown potatoes and leeks in the greenhouse area. 

## 1. Access

The ‘road’ from the school is a track all the way from the school with lots of large potholes, barely moving out of first gear in the car. 

The wall is very high! The entrance into the walled garden is quite small, too small for a tractor or a normal digger. Probably could get a mini-digger in. This will affect the pond-digging ability and costs. 

## 2. Existing features

1. **Existing fruit trees.** I suggest keeping them as they are, as they are mature and giving fruit. This includes a fig, plums, blackcurrants, apples. It’s the hardest time of year to do tree ID as the buds are just opening.  Perhaps they can be included in the design as they are?
2. **Existing greenhouse.** The green house has no glass and has not had any since Ri. has been here (30 years). There is still a solid structure of the stone walls and the metal. There is a chimney in the centre of the south-facing wall behind the greenhouse, so it was clearly a heated wall, this was quite common in these grand walled gardens for large estate houses/castles. Apparently there was a flue at both ends of the wall and so the whole south-facing wall was heated (Ri. said). The external wall was stone, and the internal wall is brick, so presumably added later for the heated wall effect. A decision should be made now about whether it is going to be kept or removed. Removing it will be harder after implementation of the garden, so would be worthwhile doing now if that’s whats going to happen eventually. It is a bit of an eyesore in a formal garden as it stands. Funding will be very unlikely unless a different organisation is set up and takes at least a lease of it. This could be a CIC (community interest company) and would need to show community benefit (not just a private garden). It would be lovely to renovate, but expensive initially and expensive to maintain it every year as the glass is likely to break in high winds. Perhaps there are specialists who could advise on a plastic substitute to glass for it. I don’t know if Solway Recycles does any see-through plastic for example. 
3. **The walls.** There are quite a few loose bricks on the northerly (south-facing) wall, and loose stones all about the rest of the garden. A professional should be engaged asap to get these all fixed up and pointed this summer, so that planting trees next to the walls is safe, and into the future.
4. **Fhe paths.** The old map shows a sturdy path in a cross from west to east and south to north. There’s no evidence of that now, only a grassy path from the west entrance to the North (greenhouse area). Ri. said that a few years ago it was very dry and the line of the paths became apparent. Ro. took photos but he couldn’t find them when he looked when Lee was visiting recently. I asked what shape they were but she couldnt recall. She said she could ask Ro., perhaps a wee phone call with him, we didn’t want to disturb him if he is unwell (nor to get too close in the circumstances). We dug where the path must have been. A hole about 1 foot. We didn’t find any slabs or impervious layer, but there were more pebbles, like they were brought from a riverbed. I guess this increases the drainage in that area, so might be why there was a drier area on a very dry summer. Leah also dug up a couple of bigger stones in further along in that path line. I would think that it would be sensible to use those same lines, as you have in the current design, as it’s nice to have the structure from the old map iterated in the current landscape. 
5. **Slope.** The hill to the east is pretty steep outside of the walls, and noticeable within the walls. I can see the benefit of a windbreak when in the north east corner to protect you from the SW prevailing winds coming up the valley. The northerly winds are also going to whip down that easterly side.  
6. **Vegetation.** The existing vegetation is rough grazing (there used to be sheep put in but not for a few years now), we noticed a lot of ground elder next to the westerly wall (near the main entrance). The ground around the fruit in the north is mossy and looks like it’s been mulched heavily until recently. We took a soil sample there too. Pigs can be a great way to clear land and get some manure into the soil. Ri. mentioned that she has a friend who keeps pigs who might be interested in keeping them there to clear the land a little. 
7. **Area around parent’s house in the SW.**  It seems like it would be nice if a little thought was put into the view from their windows (upstairs and down), in terms of it looking pretty and giving them privacy. (It’s not clear from the design if that’s been thought about. Something that can feel private for them, especially if there were to be an education centre. Also, if in the future Ro. and Ri. are not living there and Lee is living in a new house nearby, so it could be different people living in the house. Of course with the house here you need to be careful about the ponds up slope and if this might affect the house (I’m not a hydrology expert , but know this can be a problem with swales, maybe it depends on what you plan to line it with). 
8. **Back shed.** It looks like a new roof has been put on it so yes it should be fine for storage. When you got out the NW gate you are in a sheltered area too If you go left there is a storage with a vehicle, I didn’t ask about it. It’s pretty damp in there being on the north wall. There was maybe a range (like an aga) in there at some point in the past, as it was maybe a gardeners cottage, thisi is just us guessing rather than what Ri. said. 
9. **Frameyard.** It’s quite a big area. To the north is a dilapidated building (the laundry Ri. said). It would be nice if this were not in view when you step out there. I think a long windbreak on that side would be good. There is a little hill up to where you have put the elder and buartnut.I think a windbreak hedge behind that would be good. Perhaps something that will get pretty high. It might be that the laundry is taken down at some point in the future in which case it would be really exposed to the northerlies which could be quite damaging (like they were in the winter just gone). 
10. **Water.** There are the two taps in the NW, outside of the fenced area towards the greenhouse? Would be worth investigating where they come from and where the pipes go (didn’t do this today). 
11. **Existing tall trees.** Woods to the east and SE. The SE corner was overshadowed at noon (BST) from a scots pine. Also an ash, and a weeping ash. It’s quite a high corner and not an obvious location for the orchard. Might be better as a zone 5 (more intended for wildlife), and/or perhaps as the japanese garden as it will get the evening sun. 

## 3. Comments about the design

* **The overview is great.** It makes sense to follow the old path lines and quarter the whole garden, it also takes it to manageable chunks. As a permaculture teacher I’m kind of missing the zones & sectors overview map which would help to clarify what will go where.
* **The new house.** Ri. said that there is not planning permission for the new house yet. I’m not sure if the design of the whole garden should be based on a house which doesn’t have planning permission yet., as it can be hard to get. Ri. said that Lee would like to build at the top of the hill, but it’s less likely to be allowed there I’d think, since it will be visible to people across the valley too. The advantage of building low down behind the wall would be that perhaps Lee could build a ‘hut’ as it is called in legislation in scotland now. This means that you need to not be living in it for 1 month of the year and it would be a limited size. The main entrance is really to the West, but the entrances from the north will be the main vehicular access, as you can drive through the gate into the frameyard. It could be a parking place. The east gate isn’t even opening just now.
* **The area in the north** is really sheltered and sunny (south-facing) and is where the tender plants should go. It woudln’t make sense to replace the plum and fig with the italian alder. Italian alder can be free standing, doesnt need to be against the (heated?) wall. 
* **Compost bays** – seems a good spot. Perhaps small-scale compost heaps can be created in the veg area in temporary, mobile ways. You could probably get a vehicle there (e.g. if getting a delivery of manure on a tractor)
* **Is the stone pine a pine-nut?** If not I suggest they shouldn’t be put in the most gorgeously warm spot, keep that for fruit.
* **Crabapple arbour.** Do you mean something like an archway entrance with a crab apple trained over it? I think the archway can work nicely. Not sure the crabapple is the best choice in that location, perhaps that can be put as a polinator in the Southerly wall.  Patrick whitefield says not to put apples on east-facing walls. I’m sure it would be fine though. 
* **The apples on the south wall.** I suggest moving the apples into the sun, rather than against the wall as it is very shady and damp there, they wont be happy or give much fruit. Pick canker-resistant varieties. I love a Katy for example. They dont need to be against the wall at all, but can be free standing. Against the wall in the south its better if you have shade-tolerant plants, or perhaps mushroom logs.
* **Japanese garden.** I dont know if Lee has a particular association with Japan, I think these gardens can look gorgeous, mainly when they are very well maintained, so  I guess a little concern about the maintenance. Will the cherries be for blossom or fruit? Normally I think they are for blossom in a Japanese garden, so we wonder (leah suggested)  about moving the whole Japan garden into the SE corner? Keep the northerly (south-facing, sheltered) area for fruit
* **Water & ponds.** need heavy machinery and the access is small. I think it’s great that you include a pond for wildlife value, I’m just not sure if you need 3. Some of the wildlife they bring is midgies which are great for bats and birds, but still…I’m not sure how you would fill ponds in a dry summer and where the water will flow. There aren’t currently any areas which are obviously flooding, I asked Ri. and she looked surprised that I’d even asked her. (Places that are naturally wet can be good to have as wetland. )
* **Fire pit.** Lovely that you have included a fire pit for evening socialising and good that it is in the east to catch the evening sun. It looks like it might have a mound around it to shelter it (is that what you are thinking?). You might want it open to the northwest – where the sun is at sunset in the summer, rather than the southwest as that’s sunset in the winter (when we hardly see it anyway).
* **Wind breaks.** I asked Ri. how it is in the wind and she didn’t seem to know, she said there hasn’t been much storm damage. The hill to the east will give shelter. The wind will whip up from the southwest in the summer and down from the north & NW in the winter. Free standing trees of course will give shelter from the wind, not only hedging. In fact if the whole garden has trees throughout it will keep the wind above the height of the walls. Of course you might want hedging for the wildlife value, but they do require more maintenance than stand alone trees. I’m kind of thinking that the area that needs the most of a windbreak is the NE corner where the med garden is. Since that’s quite high. Maybe in the curvy line between the udo and the next path. I’d have less in the south (where you have 2 lines of wind break you could remove one for example. 
* **Nitrogen fixing plants.** I see some in the design – alder and autumn olive for example. I think more would be good. Martin Crawford’s book has information about ratios. I suggest putting them in places that are maybe not the prime locations in the garden. Alder trees can make good windbreaks having the duel purpose of providing nutrients, breaking wind, being good for wildlife and its native.
* **Gabion wall.** I dont think they would fit with the feel of a formal garden… perhaps it would be better to build a dry stane dyke as they are called here – a dry stone wall in English. This is the traditional rural skills, could be built as a workshop. Not sure it is necessary at all really. There’s a lovely example here in Gatehouse of a round wall with herbs in it, I can send you a picture if you like. 
* **You have included** some trees I’m not familiar with which is exciting. A friend of mine has planted lots of monkey puzzle trees in Balmaclellan, she did lots of research into them and reckons that in 20 years they will give lots of nuts, a bit of a gamble as you have to have male and female but just thought I’d mention it. Come back to me in 20 years and I’ll let you know if its successful!!
* **Education.** You ask about education. I’m always looking for my perfect place to hold a permaculture course (as one example of an educational workshop). My dream building is round, is pure glass to the south, east and west (with a slight overhang so the summer sun doesnt go directly into the building but the winter sun does), it has a wood burning stove. In the north it has a kitchen to cater for groups of 20 people. 20 people can sit in a circle. The floor is wooden so you can do a yoga class. Just saying… if you want education you will need a place to be with a group of people that is dry and you can hear each other talk when it is raining (not under corrugated iron roof for example). Without that I wouldn’t be bringing groups there in most seasons. The Japanese tea hut is a lovely idea for a few people but they wouldn’t fit a whole school group. I’m not sure if the maximum size of group that Lee is thinking of including. Perhaps the greenhouse can serve this purpose. There’s a lovely big greenhouse in Glasgow called the peoples palace which includes a cafe and could easily accommodate a group as well as being an inspiring greenhouse.
* **Elevation.** Just to mention that we can have frosts as late as may and as early as September. In case this is useful when considering the plants (you’ve included quite a few I’ not so familiar with).
* **Gates.** A couple of the gates could do with a joiner to look at them. The one in the east is not openable, and has a gap at the bottom (my dog found!!) and the one in the south is hard to open. In case they are being used regularly.

## 4. Planting out

L. lives locally has experience gardening, though hasn’t studied it particularly. She would be happy to have the work gardening next winter (minimum £15 per hour). I have worked with her before leading forest schools (before she moved house) and found her reliable. She also knows other local people. So the suggestion would be that I could oversee – go initially to lay out the design on the ground, and then she would happily do the work of planting trees etc. If more people are needed she knows others who live locally. I’m sure that Ri. and Ro. do too since they have been there for 30 years. 

## 5. Community engagement

There is a primary school and Closeburn House School (described as a residential school for teenagers who have social, emotional, behavioural and/or specific complex needs). We saw the teenagers walk to the junction of the track with the old ruined laundry building. They just reached it and walked back again (not turning right down to the walled garden), so they could walk to the garden if we wanted to invite them for community engagement, but they already have large grounds and I’m not sure if its a good match, depending on what Lee wants to be doing.  

Closeburn is small and there is another community project, ‘Closeburn Orchard’ which I sent a video of, that Leah told me about. Jacob (pronounced yakob) has 2 years funding. There’s a polytunnel, hut and orchard and raised beds. Apparently there are a good number of volunteers at it. It’s tiny compared to the walled garden. Once it is established there might be people who are happy to be involved in another project too. It’s a rural area and most people will have access to their own garden. I mentioned above about getting the community in. There’s such a big space it would be great to have an indoor-outdoor area for courses. As well as the fully enclosed option there’s also a structure with a (turf) roof which we built in our local school. Which is open at the sides (actually we planted trees around as hedging) so it’s sheltered.
