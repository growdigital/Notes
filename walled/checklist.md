#### Cultivated soils:

* **Basin Peat** is a type of peat. It is a poorly drained lowland peat soil with no mineral layer within 50 cm of the surface. This series covers 35 % of the unit.
* **Alluvial_pal** series belongs to the peaty alluvial soils major soil subgroup. It is a poorly drained alluvial soil with a peaty surface layer. This series covers 30 % of the unit.
* **Yarrow** series belongs to the brown earths major soil subgroup. It is a well drained soil with bright colours and a mineral topsoil, generally sandy. This series covers 35 % of the unit.
